Introduction
These standards have been developed as part of the Australian Government's introduction of the Consumer Data Right legislation to give Australians greater control over their data.

The Consumer Data Right (CDR) is intended to be applied sector by sector across the whole economy, beginning in the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors. These standards have been developed to facilitate the Consumer Data Right by acting as a specific baseline for implementation.

These standards are maintained by the Data Standards Body (DSB), with the Data Standards Chair as the decision maker. The DSB is part of the Treasury. The work of standards development is conducted in consultation with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as co-regulator of the Consumer Data Right, along with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

The standards are required to be published. The obligations on CDR participants to apply the published standards commence on the commencement of the Consumer Data Right rules:

where the rules require compliance with the standards, non-compliance with the standards may constitute a breach of the rules.
where the standards are specified as binding standards as required by the Consumer Data Right rules for the purposes of s56FA of the legislation, they apply as under contract between a data holder and an accredited data recipient. The legal effect of binding standards as between data holders and accredited data recipients is fully set out in s56FD and s56FE of the legislation.
Version
These standards represent version 1.14.0 of the high level standards. See the versioning section for more information on how versions are managed in the standard.

Interpretation
Note that, in these standards, the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

Future Dated Obligations
The standards, as published from time to time, may include specific statements indicating that a specific section of the standards will not take effect until a future date or may cease to have effect on some future date.

The table below highlights these areas of the standards.

High Level Standards
This section contains components of the standards that are foundational and generally applicable.

Principles
The following principles, classified as Outcome Principles and Technical Principles, are the basis for the development of the standards for the Consumer Data Right.

Outcome Principles
These principles articulate qualitative outcomes that the API definitions should seek to deliver.

Outcome Principle 1: APIs are secure
The API definitions will consider and incorporate the need for a high degree of security to protect customer data. This includes the risk of technical breach but also additional concerns of inadvertent data leakage through overly broad data payloads and scopes. The security of customer data is a first order outcome that the API standards must seek to deliver.

Outcome Principle 2: APIs use open standards
In order to promote widespread adoption, open standards that are robust and widely used in the industry will be used wherever possible.

Outcome Principle 3: Data sharing provides a positive consumer experience
The standards will ensure that CDR consumers have simple, informed, and trustworthy data sharing experiences that provide them with positive outcomes over the short and long term.

Outcome Principle 4: APIs provide a good developer experience
To ensure that the entry hurdle for new developers is low the experience of the developers that are building clients using the APIs will be considered. The ability for a developer to easily understand and write code using the APIs in modern development environments should be facilitated by the API standards.

Outcome Principle 5: Standards are consistent across sectors
The standards will strive for consistency in patterns, structure, security mechanisms and user experience across sectors to facilitate the development of customer experiences and services that are able to integrate data from multiple sectors seamlessly and to reduce the cost of customer education for new sectors.

Technical Principles
These principles articulate specific technical outcomes that the API definitions should seek to deliver.

Technical Principle 1: APIs are RESTful
The API standards will adhere to RESTful API concepts where possible and sensible to do so. In particular the concepts of statelessness and resource orientation will be followed.

Technical Principle 2: APIs are implementation agnostic
The underlying implementation of the APIs should not be constrained or driven by the API definitions and standards. Conversely, the underlying implementation choices should not be visible or derivable to the client applications using the APIs.

Technical Principle 3: APIs are simple
As complexity will increase implementation costs for both holders and clients as well as reduce the utility of the APIs, API definitions should seek to be as simple as possible but no simpler.

Technical Principle 4: APIs are rich in capability
As the APIs are defined care should be taken to ensure that the data payloads defined represent rich data sets that can be used in many scenarios, including scenarios not necessarily front of mind during the design process.

Technical Principle 5: APIs are performant
The API definitions should consider and incorporate performance implications during design ensuring that repeated calls are not necessary for simple use cases and that payload sizes do not introduce performance issues.

Technical Principle 6: APIs are consistent
The API definitions across the full suite of APIs should be consistent with each other as much as possible. Where possible common data structures and patterns should be defined and reused.

Technical Principle 7: APIs are version controlled and backwards compatible
As the API definitions evolve care will be taken to ensure the operation of existing clients are protected when breaking changes occur. Breaking changes will be protected by a well-defined version control model and by a policy of maintaining previous versions for a period of time to allow for backwards compatibility.

Technical Principle 8: APIs are extensible
The API definitions and standards should be built for extensibility. This extensibility should accommodate future API categories and industry sectors but it should also allow for extension by data holders to create unique, value add offerings to the ecosystem.

Consumer Experience Principles
These principles articulate qualitative outcomes for consumer experience that the standards should seek to deliver.

CX Principle 1: The CDR is Consumer-centric
The CDR consumer experience is intuitive and is centred on consumer attitudes, needs, behaviours, and expectations – noting that these may change over time.

CX Principle 2: The CDR is Accessible and Inclusive
A diverse range of people are able to access, use, and comprehend the CDR ecosystem regardless of their background, situation, experience, or personal characteristics.

CX Principle 3: The CDR is Comprehensible
When interacting with the CDR, consumers are able to understand the following:

who their data is shared with;
what information is shared;
when sharing begins and ceases;
where data is shared to and from;
why their data is being requested; and
how they can manage and control the sharing and use of their data.
CX Principle 4: The CDR is Simple and Empowering
Consumer interactions with the CDR are as simple as possible, but not at the expense of informed consent, consumer control, transparency, privacy, or comprehension. Consumers should be encouraged to be privacy conscious without experiencing cognitive loads that lead to disengagement. Consumers should also be empowered by the CDR without interactive burdens being placed on them.

CX Principle 5: Consent is Current
Consent is granted at a point in time and is only as current as the consumer’s original intent. Consumer attitudes and behaviours may change over time and be impacted by external events such as the expansion of the CDR or consumer awareness. Consent terms should always align to current consumer preferences.

Versioning
The standards have adopted a two level versioning strategy. The high level standards (including principles, Uniform Resource Identifier structure, payload naming conventions, etc) be versioned and each API end point will have an additional version specific to that end point.

Documentation Versioning
Sample versioning of the standards documentation is as follows: 1.12.2 - meaning major version 1, minor version 12 and bugfix version 2

The standards documentation will be versioned using three version parts <major>.<minor>.<bug fix>. This version will be used to describe updates in the Change Log.

Each of the three components will be independently incrementing integers and are described as follows:

major: Major version of the standards. Reserved for increment only when a set of changes are applied that are large enough to make co-existence in the same implementation environment with previous versions untenable. This would include major changes to the information security profile, major changes to the high level standards or a change in basic protocols.
minor: Significant changes to the standards. This would include changes that require approval by the Chair of the Data Standards Body such as new end points and new versions of existing end points.
bug fix: Minor documentation changes that clarify or correct the standards but do not meaningfully alter the standards.
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Versioning
The base path structure containing the "version" for this standard is:
https://<holder-path>/cds-au/v<major version>/<industry>

The high level standard will be versioned as described above. The major component of this version will be embedded in the URI Structure for the APIs. This allows for a data holder to support multiple major versions of the standards in production even if the significant breaking changes occur between major versions.

End Point Versioning
Each end point will have multiple versions independent of other end points. A specific end point version will be requested by a client using a HTTP header. This header will be supported by all end points under the API standards. See the section on HTTP Headers for more information on how versions are requested and supplied under the standards.

URI Structure
Some example URIs that meet this standard are:

1. https://www.bank.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/banking/accounts  
2. https://www.bank.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/banking/accounts/abc123/transactions/?x=y#bar  
3. https://www.bank.com.au/complex/uri/taxonomy/cds-au/v1/banking/products?page=2  
4. https://www.energyretailer.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/energy/usage  
5. https://www.energyretailer.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/ACME/apply  
The holder path for each example is:

1. www.bank.com.au/api  
2. www.bank.com.au/api   
3. www.bank.com.au/complex/uri/taxonomy  
4. www.energyretailer.com.au/api  
5. www.energyretailer.com.au/api
The base path for each example is:

1. https://www.bank.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/banking  
2. https://www.bank.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/banking   
3. https://www.bank.com.au/complex/uri/taxonomy/cds-au/v1/banking  
4. https://www.energyretailer.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/energy  
5. https://www.energyretailer.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/ACME
The resource path for each example is:

1. https://www.bank.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/banking/accounts
2. https://www.bank.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/banking/accounts/abc123/transactions
3. https://www.bank.com.au/complex/uri/taxonomy/cds-au/v1/banking/products
4. https://www.energyretailer.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/energy/usage
5. https://www.energyretailer.com.au/api/cds-au/v1/ACME/apply
The URI structure for API end points in the standards MUST be implemented as follows:
uri-string =  "https://" <holder-path> "/" cds-au "/" <version> "/" ( <industry> | <HID> ) "/" <resource>


The components of this URI structure are described as follows:

<holder-path>  = string.
The holder path is a path set by the data holder. It can be any URI desired by the holder. While all authenticated end points must be accessible under the same holder path the data holder may stipulate a different holder path for unauthenticated end points.

cds-au         = "cds-au" string.
This is a static string representing the end points defined by the Consumer Data Standards for Australia. This static string allows for separation from other APIs available at the same base holder path and also allows for extension if the standards are adopted by another jurisdiction in whole or in part.

<version>      = "v1" string.
The major version of the high level standards. This is not the version of the endpoint or the payload being requested but the version of the overall standards being applied. This version number will be “v” followed by the major version of the standards as a positive integer (e.g. v1, v12 or v76).

<industry>     = banking / energy / telco / common
A static string used to separate APIs for a specific industry. As standards for new industries are defined the list of industry strings will be extended.
Note that the currently accepted values for the industry component of the base path are:
banking = "banking" string. For APIs related to banking and potentially wider financial services data,
energy  = "energy" string. For APIs related to the energy distribution industry,
telco   = "telco" string. For APIs related to telecommunications,
common  = "common" string. For APIs that potentially span industries.

<HID>          = string.
The Holder Identifier used to denote extension API categories for a specific holder.

<resource>     = string.
The URI for the specific resource requested. This end point URI will be defined as part of the end point definitions for each API group.

Base Path
Base path is intended to be the portion of the URL up to but not including the endpoint resource. In other words, the base path is the portion of the URL up to and including the <industry> or <HID> component. The base path string is defined as follows:

https:// <holder-path> / cds-au / <version> / ( <industry> | <HID> )

Resource Path
The resource path is intended to be the portion of the URL including the base path and resource location. The resource path string is defined as: <base-path> / <resource>.

Resource URIs
Resources that are collections, and members of collections, will follow the JSONAPI.org recommendation.

Under this model, collections, individual members and collection sub-resources would be accessed as follows:

GET …/accounts	Returns an array of accounts
GET …/accounts/{id}	Returns the detail of a specific account
GET …/accounts/transactions	Returns the transactions of multiple accounts
GET …/accounts/{id}/transactions	Returns the transactions of a specific account
POST …/accounts	Create a new account
POST …/accounts/search	Returns an array of accounts based on a complex query
The final example above represents a complex query accessed via a POST request. In this situation the POST URI should be applied to a sub-resource of the collection. A POST to a collection is reserved for the creation of a new collection member.

If no valid sub-resource exists then a dedicated sub-resource should be created, such as the “search” URI listed in the example above.

HTTP Headers
Supported HTTP headers, and their usage, for the standards are as laid out in the following sections.

Request Headers
A sample set of headers requesting version 3 to 5:

Content-Type : application/json;charset=UTF-8
Accept : application/json;charset=UTF-8
x-v : 5
x-min-v : 3
x-fapi-interaction-id : 6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8
x-fapi-auth-date : Thu, 16 Jan 2020 16:50:15 GMT
x-fapi-customer-ip-address : 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
x-cds-client-headers : TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFgxMTsgTGludXggeDg2XzY0KSBBcHBsZVdlYktpdC81MzcuMzYgKEtIVE1MLCBsaWtlIEdlY2tvKSBDaHJvbWUvNzkuMC4zOTQ1Ljg4IFNhZmFyaS81MzcuMzY=

A Data Holder must be able to process Content-Type headers in accordance with [RFC7231]. The following would be valid:

Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Type: AppliCAtion/JSon;Charset=uTf-8

A Data Holder must be able to process Accept headers in accordance with [RFC7231]. The following would be valid:

Accept: */*
Accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: charset=UTF-8
Accept: AppliCAtion/JSon;Charset=uTf-8

Header Field	Description	Mandatory?
Content-Type	Standard HTTP Header. Represents the format of the payload provided in the request. The media type must be set to application/json. Mandatory for PUT and POST calls.	Conditional
Accept	If specified, the media type must be set to application/json, unless otherwise specified in the resource end point standard.

If set to an unacceptable value the holder must respond with a 406 Not Acceptable. If not specified, or a wildcard (*/*) is provided, the default media type is application/json.	Optional
x-v	Version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer. The holder should respond with the highest supported version between x-min-v and x-v. If the value of x-min-v is equal to or higher than the value of x-v then the x-min-v header should be treated as absent.
If all versions requested are not supported then the holder must respond with a 406 Not Acceptable.	Mandatory
x-min-v	Minimum version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer if provided. The holder should respond with the highest supported version between x-min-v and x-v. If the value of x-min-v is equal to or higher than the value of x-v then the x-min-v header should be treated as absent.
If all versions requested are not supported then the holder must respond with a 406 Not Acceptable.	Optional
x-<HID>-v	A holder specific version of extension fields. Should not be used in conjunction with x-min-v.	Optional
x-fapi-interaction-id	An optional [RFC4122] UUID used as a correlation id. If provided, the data holder must "play back" this value in the x-fapi-interaction-id response header.	Optional
x-fapi-auth-date	The time when the customer last logged in to the Data Recipient Software Product as described in [FAPI-R]. Required for all resource calls (customer present and unattended). Not required for unauthenticated calls.	Conditional
x-fapi-customer-ip-address	The customer's original IP address if the customer is currently logged in to the Data Recipient Software Product. The presence of this header indicates that the API is being called in a customer present context. Not to be included for unauthenticated calls.	Conditional
x-cds-client-headers	The customer's original standard http headers Base64 encoded, including the original User Agent header, if the customer is currently logged in to the Data Recipient Software Product. Mandatory for customer present calls. Not required for unattended or unauthenticated calls.
This header is not required to include:
Headers containing security information
Custom or proprietary headers used to facilitate the client application
Conditional
Response headers
Header Field	Description	Mandatory?
Content-Type	Standard HTTP Header. Represents the format of the payload returned in the response.
Must be application/json unless otherwise specified in the resource end point standard.	Mandatory
Retry-After	Header indicating the time (in seconds) that the client should wait before retrying an operation. The holder should include this header along with responses with the HTTP status code of 429 Too many requests.	Optional
x-v	The version of the API end point that the holder has responded with.	Mandatory
x-fapi-interaction-id	An [RFC4122] UUID used as a correlation id. The data holder must set the response header x-fapi-interaction-id to the value received from the corresponding request header or to a new [RFC4122] UUID value if the request header was not provided. This header MUST be responded for success and error responses for authenticated APIs.	Mandatory
Additional Headers
Generally understood headers used in HTTP transactions to provide caching guidance and the use of the compression are not specified but are considered acceptable. It is at the discretion of the data holder if these headers are used for a specific implementation. Data holders should not require these headers for successful API access, however.

HTTP Response Codes
The handling and usage of HTTP response codes for the standards will be according to the following table.

Situation	HTTP Status	Notes	POST	GET	DELETE
Query completed successfully	200 OK		Yes	Yes	No
Normal execution. The request has succeeded.	201 Created	The operation results in the creation of a new resource.	Yes	No	No
Delete operation completed successfully	204 No Content		No	No	Yes
The response is not modified since last call	304 Not Modified	May be returned if standard caching headers such as ETag or If-modified-since are utilised	Yes	Yes	No
Request has malformed, missing or non-compliant JSON body or URL parameters	400 Bad Request	The requested operation will not be carried out.	Yes	Yes	Yes
Authorization header missing or invalid token	401 Unauthorized	The operation was refused access. Re-authenticating may result in an appropriate token that may be used.	Yes	Yes	Yes
Token has incorrect scope or a security policy was violated.	403 Forbidden	The operation was refused access. Re-authenticating is unlikely to remediate the situation. It is expected that this error will result in an error payload	Yes	Yes	Yes
The resource matching the request URI is not known or is unable to be processed due to business logic specific to the resource being requested	404 Not Found	No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. This response code MUST NOT be used for resources presented in the body of the request.	Yes	Yes	Yes
The consumer tried to access the resource with a method that is not supported.	405 Method Not Allowed		Yes	Yes	Yes
The request contained an Accept header other than permitted media types, a character set other than UTF-8 or a version that was not supported	406 Not Acceptable		Yes	Yes	Yes
The operation was refused because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource.	415 Unsupported Media Type		Yes	No	No
The request was well formed but was unable to be processed due to business logic specific to the request	422 Unprocessable Entity	If applicable to the HTTP method it is expected that this error will result in an error payload	Yes	Yes	No
The operation was refused as too many requests have been made within a certain timeframe.	429 Too Many Requests	Throttling is a NFR. The data holder should include a Retry-After header in the response indicating how long the data consumer must wait before retrying the operation.	Yes	Yes	Yes
Something went wrong on the API gateway or micro-service	500 Internal Server Error	The operation failed.	Yes	Yes	Yes
Service is currently unavailable	503 Service Unavailable		Yes	Yes	Yes
The server was unable to respond in a timely manner	504 Gateway Timeout	Returned if a timeout has occurred but a resend of the original request is viable (otherwise use 500 instead)	Yes	Yes	Yes
Payload Conventions
This section of the standard outlines the request and response payload structures for all API end points as well as the naming conventions for fields.

Request Payload Structure
A sample request would be structured as follows:

{
  “data”: {
    ...
  },
  “meta”: {
    ...
  }
}
Each API request payload MUST have a JSON object at the root level known as the root object. This object MUST contain a data object to hold the primary data for the request.

The root object will contain a meta object if, and only if, it is specifically REQUIRED by the end point. The meta object is used to provide additional information such as second factor authorisation data, traffic management, pagination counts or other purposes that are complementary to the workings of the API.

The definition of the contents for the data object and meta object will be defined separately for each end point.

Response Payload Structure
A sample successful response:

{
  “data”: {
    ...
  },
  “links”: {
    “self”: “...”
  },
  “meta”: {
    ...
  }
}
A sample unsuccessful response:

{
  “errors”: [
    {
      “code”: “...”,
      “title”: “...”,
      “detail”: “...”
    }, {
      “code”: “...”,
      “title”: “...”,
      “detail”: “...”,
      “meta”: {
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
Each API request payload MUST have a JSON object at the root level known as the root object.

The contents of the root object are as follows:

If the response is successful (200 OK) the root object:
MUST contain a data object
MUST contain a links object
MAY contain a meta object if REQUIRED by the definition of the specific end point
If the response is unsuccessful (not 200 OK) the root object:
MAY contain an errors object (as per the specific end point definition)
The definition of the contents for the data object and meta object will be defined separately for each end point.

The links object will contain links to related API end points. This will include links to support pagination.

The links object MUST contain a field named self that will have the fully qualified URI to the current request as a value.

The errors object is defined in the Error Codes section.

Field Naming Conventions
Valid Characters In Field Names
All field names defined in either a request or response payload MUST be treated as case sensitive by clients and servers, and they MUST meet all of the following conditions:

Member names MUST contain at least one character.
Member names MUST contain only the allowed characters listed below:
U+0061 to U+007A, a-z
U+0041 to U+005A, A-Z
U+0030 to U+0039, 0-9
Additionally, the following characters are allowed in field names, except as the first or last character:
U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, '-'
U+005F LOW LINE, '_'
U+0024 DOLLAR SIGN, '$'
Any other character MUST NOT be used in field names.

Field Naming Style
Field names MUST be meaningful names with defined semantics.

Fields representing the same data in different payloads or different parts of a payload MUST have the same name.

Array types SHOULD have plural field names. All other field names SHOULD be singular.

Field names MUST be defined using camel case with the following clarifications:

If a field name is a single acronym it SHOULD be lowercase
If a field name contains an acronym along with other words it MAY be uppercase
The first character in a field name SHOULD be lower case unless it is part of an acronym
Fields MUST NOT be named using reserved javascript tokens.

Maps
For JSON maps (i.e. key/value pairs) any Unicode character MAY be used as a field name and stylistic requirements do not apply.

Field Property Conventions
Field Data Types
Each field defined for the payloads of an end point MUST have an assigned data type.

The list of valid data types are set out in the common field types section. If a custom data type is required for a field then the field SHOULD be classified as a string with a clear description of how the property value is to be interpreted or defined.

Mandatory/Optional Fields
Each field defined for the payloads of an end point MUST have an assigned status of mandatory, optional or conditional.

Mandatory fields MUST be present and have a non-null value in a request or response payload for the payload to be considered valid.

Optional fields MAY be present but this is not guaranteed. It is also valid for these fields to be present but have a null value. Note that optional fields indicate that data may sometimes not be held by a Data Holder and this is an expected scenario.

Conditional fields MUST have an associated conditional statement. If the conditional statement is true in a specific request or response the field is considered mandatory. If the conditional statement is false then the field is considered optional.

 Note that optional fields are not considered optionally implementable by a Data Holder. For instance, if a Data Holder holds data in digital form for a Customer that is represented in a payload then it is expected that this data will be shared when authorised by the Customer. For payloads unrelated to Customers, such as product reference data, there is more discretion for the Data Holder but other drivers, such as complementary regulation or the requirement to align to other channels, should be taken into consideration.
Empty/Null Fields
An empty field (ie. a field that is not present in a payload) will be considered equivalent with a field that is present with a null value.

An empty string (“”) is not considered to be equivalent to null.

A Boolean value of false is not considered to be equivalent to null. Optional Boolean fields, by implication, have three possible values: true, false and indeterminate (ie. null).

Object conventions
Sample union object structure:

“data”: {
    [
        {
            “shapeUType”: “circle”,
            “circle”: {
            }
        },
        {
            “shapeUType”: “square”,
            “square”: {
            }
        }
    ]
}
A specific convention will apply to union objects.

In the standards a union object is used in a situation where a set of data can be represented with different sets of fields depending on the context. To maintain strong typing of the fields one of a series of known object structures will be used. An example where this technique is used in the standard is in the definition of account balances where balance information can be represented differently, but unambiguously, for different account types.

For union objects an additional field, with a known suffix, is used to identify the object type that has been provided specifically.

As the name of this field is constant it can be used to perform an indirect lookup on the object type that has actually been provided removing the need to scan for which object is present.

A field of this type will always be specified with the suffix UType meaning Union Type.

Array Conventions
Samples for providing array values:

## Many-values:
"middleNames": ["Geoff", "John"],
"errors": [
    {
      "code": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "detail": "..."
    }, {
      "code": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "detail": "..."
    }
]

## Single-value:
"middleNames": ["Geoff"],
"errors": [
    {
      "code": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "detail": "..."
    }
]

## Empty array:
"middleNames": [ ],
"errors": [ ]

Unless otherwise stated within the data standards, arrays are explicitly expressed in response payloads.

Mandatory fields
In objects where an array field is defined as having 0..n values, the array field must be explicitly expressed as an array in the payload, even if it only contains one item or is empty.

This applies equally for object arrays. Where a field is defined as an array value, the response should be: * an array of objects, * an array of values, or * an empty array ([]).

An empty array is the representation for an array equivalent to an empty string.

Optional fields
If the field is optional a null value or omission of the field in the response is accepted.

Normative references
The only exception to this, unless explicitly stated, is normative standards. The requirements for expressing arrays within those normative standards apply per the normative references.

“1.999”
MaskedPANString	Masked credit card number. Lower case ‘x’ should be used to mask numbers and only the last four digits should be exposed to facilitate identification. This type is expected to be used for display so the format should be logical for this context	"xxxx xxxx xxxx 1234"
MaskedAccountString	Masked bank account number genericised for a variety of account types. Should be represented as the full account number would normally be represented for display (including formatting) but with all digits except the last four replaced with a lowercase x.

URIString	A valid URI	"http://www.google.com"
ExternalRef	The format is defined by an external reference such as ISO standard or an RFC	Swift bank codes using ISO 9362
Pagination
Each API end point that can return multiple records will stipulate whether pagination is supported for the end point or not. For end points that will return less than a reasonably sized page of results in the majority of circumstances support for paging may not be included.

Note that the use of paging for an end point does not require or preclude the use of filtering query parameters. It is expected that filtering and paging will be applied independently of each other.

Query Parameters
The consumer will stipulate pagination requirements on the request using query parameters. When paging is supported the consumer MAY provide the following query parameters:

page – the page number being requested (with the first page being 1)
page-size – the number of records to return in each page
If the query parameters are not provided the following defaults will be assumed:

page – a default of 1 (the first page) will be assumed
page-size – a default of 25 will be assumed
Response Fields
In addition to the data requested a holder MUST provide the following additional information in the response payload:

In the links object the following fields are to be provided:
first - A URI to request the first page. Mandatory if this response is not the first page.
last - A URI to request the last page. Mandatory if this response is not the last page.
prev - A URI to the previous page. Mandatory if this response is not the first page.
next - A URI to the next page. Mandatory if this response is not the last page.
In the meta object the following fields are to be provided:
totalRecords - The total number of records in the set. This field MUST be present.
totalPages - The total number of pages in the set. This field MUST be present. If totalRecords is 0 totalPages MUST be 0.
For each of these fields the page size specified in the request should be assumed when calculating values.

Additional Pagination Rules
Holders are not expected to implement pagination with transaction isolation. The underlying data-set may change between two subsequent requests. This may result in situations where the same transaction is returned on more than one page.
A maximum page size of 1000 records is assumed for all end points (unless otherwise stipulated in the end point definition). If a page size greater than this maximum is requested then an Invalid Page Size error SHOULD be returned.
Cursor Support
For performance reasons data holders may wish to support other pagination patterns such as cursors or continuation tokens. While the standard does not explicitly support these additional mechanisms it is considered allowable to implement these patterns and expose them via the pagination links.

In this scenario the URIs included in the links for other pages may not be compliant with the standard and may, instead, include other query parameters that support another pagination pattern. It is expected that all other pagination requirements such as link fields and meta fields will still be supported if other patterns are implemented.

To allow for a more performant implementation data consumers are encouraged to utilise pagination links wherever possible and only use constructed URIs for the first page or if random access to a specific set of records is required.

ID Permanence
Within these standards resource IDs are REQUIRED to comply with the following:

An ID for a resource should only be specified in the API standard if an end point exists to obtain detail for that resource or to change the state of the resource.
If an ID is specified in the standards for a resource then it is mandatory and MUST be supplied, by the data holder, in accordance with the standards.
If an ID is specified the ID value MUST be entirely arbitrary and have no inherent meaning. For instance, an ID should not be a combination of other fields or a string that can be parsed to extract meaningful information.
IDs SHOULD be unique but that uniqueness may be within a clearly bounded context. For example, a beneficiary ID may be unique but only in the context of a specific account. The bounds of uniqueness should be clearly described in the standards definition for the end point.
IDs MUST be immutable across sessions and consents but MUST NOT be transferable across Data Recipient Software Products. For example, "Data Recipient Software Product "A" obtaining an account ID would get a different result from "Data Recipient Software Product B" obtaining the ID for the same account even if the same customer authorised the access. Under this constraint IDs cannot be usefully transferred between client organisations or data holders.
IDs MUST NOT be transferable between different customers for the same Data Recipient Software Product. For example, a Data Recipient Software Product should obtain a different ID for a joint account if the ID was obtained independently using authorisations from both customers.
In payloads the field name of “id” should NEVER be used. Each ID field should be meaningfully named so that wherever that ID is used across multiple end points it always refers to the same ID set. For instance, the IDs for accounts would be represented in JSON in a field named “accountId”.
Error Codes
These standards define a standard list of error codes that Data Recipient Software Products and Data Holders SHOULD or MUST conform to. Further,

Data Recipient Software Products and Data Holders SHOULD use the standard error codes as defined
Where a specific error code MUST be responded, this requirement is stated against the applicable error code or API endpoints
Where a specific error code MAY be responded, this requirement is stated against the applicable error code or API endpoints
Data Recipient Software Products and Data Holders MAY respond with application-specific error codes and in doing so, MUST respond with the MetaError » urn field populated with the standard CDR error code.
Error Response Structure
Non-Normative Example

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "urn:au-cds:error:cds-banking:Authorisation/UnavailableBankingAccount",
      "title": "Unavailable Banking Account",
      "detail": "808b5b1d-0798-4bdf-a3c8-f9cce2904eb2"
    }
  ]
}
The errors object will be an array of zero or more unnamed objects. The fields in each of these objects will be as follows:

code field MUST be present: holds an end point specific error code. This MAY be a standard CDR error code or an application-specific error code.
title field MUST be present: holds a human readable label of the error that is constant per code
detail field MUST be present: holds a human readable description of this specific error
meta object MAY be present: holds additional end point specific data relevant to the error
If a Data Recipient Software Product or Data Holder responds with an application-specific error code, the standard CDR URN error code MUST be provided in the MetaError object.

URN Structure
When responding with a standard CDR error code, the URN structure is defined as follows:

urn-string = "urn:" NID ":" metatype ":" sub-type ":" error-category "/" error-code

NID            = "au-cds" string.

metatype       = "error" string.

sub-type       = cds-all / cds-register / cds-banking / cds-energy
cds-all      = "cds-all" string. An error code common to all API responses,
cds-register = "cds-register" string. Reserved for CDR Register issued error codes only,
cds-banking  = "cds-banking" string. An error code specific to the CDR banking APIs only,
cds-energy   = "cds-energy" string. An error code specific to the CDR energy APIs only.

error-category = string. The high-level category code for the error defined in the Consumer Data Standards

error-code     = string. The specific error encountered, defined in the Consumer Data Standards

Standard Error Codes
A list of standard error codes to help categorise an error response. The applicable HTTP response code is also given.

Processing Errors
When a server encounters multiple problems for a single request, the most generally applicable HTTP error code SHOULD be used in the response. For instance, 400 Bad Request might be appropriate for multiple 4xx errors or 500 Internal Server Error might be appropriate for multiple 5xx errors.

A server MAY choose to stop processing as soon as a problem is encountered, or it MAY continue processing and encounter multiple problems. For instance, a server might process multiple attributes and then return multiple validation problems in a single response.

Extensibility And Application Specific Errors
Error handling has been designed with extensibility in mind. Where an application supports error codes specific to that implementation, it is intended that implementations can extend the standard CDR error codes with application-specific error responses whilst maintaining interoperability for clients.

Non-Normative Example

# Application-specific error code extends a standard CDR error code with
# details specific to the Data Holder
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "acme-bank:JointAccountElectionRemoved",
      "title": "Joint Account Consent Election Is Removed",
      "detail": "Description of the specific error encountered",
      "meta": {
        "urn": "urn:au-cds:error:cds-banking:Authorisation/UnavailableBankingAccount"
      }
    }
  ]
}
To assist clients, the Data Recipient Software Product or Data Holder MUST provide the application-specific error code in the ResponseErrorListV2 » code and the standard CDR error code in the ResponseErrorListV2 » MetaError » urn field denoting the standard error code the implementation extends.

Transition arrangements
Non-Normative Examples

# Application-specific error code before transition

{ "errors": [
  {
    "code": "old error code",
    "title": "error message",
    "detail": "Description of the specific error encountered"
  }
] }

# Application-specific error code during transition

{ "errors": [
  {
    "code": "old error code",
    "title": "error message",
    "detail": "Description of the specific error encountered",
    "meta": {
      "urn": "urn:au-cds:error:cdr-all:Header/UnsupportedVersion"
    }
  }
] }

# Standardised-error code after retirement of application-specific error code

{ "errors": [
  {
    "code": "urn:au-cds:error:cdr-all:Header/UnsupportedVersion",    
    "title": "Unsupported Version",
    "detail": "'x-v' **MUST** be greater than or equal to '2'"
  }
] }
If Data Recipient Software Products or Data Holders support custom error codes prior to February 1st 2022, the following transition arrangements apply:

Effective as soon as standardised error codes are supported by the Data Recipient Software Product or Data Holder:

If the Data Recipient Software Product or Data Holder supports application-specific error codes they MUST publish a mapping of those codes to the standard CDR error codes in a developer friendly way that is discoverable and freely available.
Data Recipient Software Products and Data Holders MAY publish this mapping any time prior to February 1st 2022.
Effective from February 1st 2022: Data Holders and Data Recipient Software Products MUST support standardised error codes by this date and continue to support any custom error codes.

Standardised error codes MUST be provided in the ResponseErrorListV2 » MetaError » urn field
If applicable, application specific error codes MUST be provided in the ResponseErrorListV2 » code
Data Recipient Software Products and Data Holders MAY phase their transition to support standardised error codes such as by endpoint or per error code if preferred prior to this date.
Effective from November 1st 2022: Data Holders and Data Recipient Software Products MAY deprecate any custom error codes

Standardised error codes MAY be provided in the ResponseErrorListV2 » code field if no application-specific error code applies
Application-specific error codes MAY be provided in the ResponseErrorListV2 » code
Extensibility
The Consumer Data Right standards will not cover all possible data sets or APIs that participants may wish to expose. Participants may also wish to innovate on top of the API standards by offering additional data to meet specific market opportunities. It is desirable that the standards not only allow for this to occur but actively encourage it with specific additions to the standards to enable such extension.

At the same time, it is important that a participant seeking to provide extensions does not hinder a data consumer that is only built for the published standards.

To accommodate these concerns the standards incorporate the following considerations specifically related to extension by data holders.

The three types of extension that the standards address are:

Data holder offering entirely new API categories that are not covered by the API Standards
Data holder offering additional end points to an API category that is already covered by the standards
Data holder offering additional fields to the response payloads for an end point defined in the standards
Holder Identifier
For example, the prefixes for the four major Banks included in the first phases of implementation would be:

CBA – Commonwealth Bank
WBC – Westpac Banking Corporation
ANZ – ANZ Banking Group
NAB – National Australia Bank
Data holders seeking to extend the standards MUST nominate a prefix to identify all extensions. Extended fields and end points and would use this prefix consistently. This prefix would be, by preference, the ASX symbol for the holder. Care should be taken not to use a prefix already adopted by another holder in the regime.

In these standards, where a Holder Identifier would be included, the term <HID> will be used.

New API Categories
When extending by adding new API categories a holder MUST add these to the overall URI structure by substituting the industry element with the Holder (Provider) ID.

For instance, the standard URI base path is structured as:
https:// <holder-path> / cds-au / <version> / <industry> / <resource>

For the extension API categories for a specific holder they would be structured as:
https:// <holder-path> / cds-au / <version> / <HID> / <resource>

The end points defined under this structure, including the payloads of these end points do not need to be prefixed in any way. The fact that they are underneath the holder section implies that they are additional to the standard.

Note that:

This mechanism MUST NOT be used to create modified duplicates of the end points defined in the API Standards
The end points in this area MUST comply with the standard's conventions and principles including naming conventions and data types.
New End Points In Existing API Categories
When creating new end points that are in parallel to existing API categories in the standard the Holder Identifier MUST be used to prefix the highest URI element where divergence occurs.

For example, assume an existing balance end point is defined as follows:
<base-path>/accounts/{account ID}/transactions

and the holder wishes to add an end point that summarises balance movement for a specific time period then they may define the end point as:
<base-path>/account/{account ID}/<HID>-balance-movement

Note that:

The prefix is defined as the Holder Identifier followed by a hyphen.
As the entire end point is new, the request and payload fields do not need to be prefixed in any way.
Care should be taken to ensure there is no collision with an end point defined in the standards by specifying an extension at the same level as a variable URI element (such as at the same level of the {account ID} in the example above).
If an end point has multiple levels in the resource path only the highest point where divergence with the standard occurs needs to be prefixed.
The new end point MUST comply with standard's conventions and principles including naming conventions and data types.
Additional Fields In An Existing Response Payload
When adding a new field in an existing payload the field can be added to the JSON by prefixing the string <HID>-.

If an object is being added as an extension only the highest level object name needs to be prefixed. Any fields inside the extended object can be named normally.

Note that:

Existing fields MUST NOT be modified in any way. This includes adding new enumeration values to enum type fields.
A mandatory field MUST NOT be made optional as the result of an extension.
Request payloads can also be extended but the resulting end point should still execute successfully if the extension field is not present (by implication, extension fields in request payloads MUST be optional).
New query parameters MAY be added along the same lines as a new field in a request payload (i.e. prefixed, non-mandatory and no side effects if not present).
New headers MAY be added along the same lines as a new field in a request payload with the exception that the new header should be prefixed x-<HID>-.
New fields MUST comply with the naming conventions and data type standards used.
Additional Query Parameters
When adding support for a new query parameter to an existing end point that a data consumer is expected to supply, the new parameter should be prefixed by the string <HID>- to avoid potential collision with extension by another data holder.

Extension Versioning
As described previously in the versioning section the standard provides for multiple versions of each API end point. This implies the need for extensions to also be versioned.

An optional header x-<HID>-v will be supported for all end points that can be used by the data consumer to request a specific version of extension fields to include in the response. See the section on HTTP Headers for more information on the use of this header.

Consumer Experience
The Consumer Experience (CX) Standards contain requirements for the creation of implementations by both Data Recipients and Data Holders. The full list of CX Standards can be found below.

The CX Guidelines provide examples and recommendations for how to implement key rules and standards that relate to the consumer experience. They can be found along with additional CX commentary at:

CX Guidelines
Data Language Standards: Common

Example of data language standards presented in a consumer-facing interaction, where [1] refers to Data cluster language, and [2] refers to Data permission language.

In accordance with CDR Rule 8.11 (1)(d), a data standard must be made to provide descriptions of the types of data to be used by CDR participants in making and responding to requests. Adherence to this language will help ensure there is a consistent interpretation and description of the consumer data that will be shared across different CDR implementations.

Area	CX Standard
Data Language Standards: Language to be used	
Data Recipients and Data Holders MUST use data language standards to describe data clusters and permissions in consumer-facing interactions. See the Banking Language section for language to be used when requesting banking data; and the Energy Language section for language to be used when requesting energy data.

Data language standards MUST be used when CDR data is being requested, reviewed, or access to such data is withdrawn.

Data Recipients and Data Holders MUST use the appropriate data standards language for business consumers as denoted with an '*' for the relevant data.

Data Recipients and Data Holders SHOULD expand on the proposed language where appropriate to communicate further details of what is being shared.

Additional details MAY include additional information in context, such as in-line help or tool tips, and/or additional permissions where they may exist.

Examples of permission details that MAY be used and provided as in-line help are denoted with an '†' for the relevant data.

Data Language Standards: Detailed scope requests	
If a scenario requires it, Data Holders and Data Recipients MUST merge and amend Basic and Detailed data cluster and permission language to show that Detailed scopes include Basic data.

Data Holders and Data Recipients MUST use the alternative language denoted with an '‡' for the relevant scope(s). See the Banking Language section for banking data and the Energy Language section for energy data.

Example: A Data Recipient presents the Detailed data cluster in a data request to a consumer, but does not present the Basic data cluster. The Detailed scope includes Basic data, but this is not apparent to the consumer based on the data cluster language and permissions used for the Detailed scope.

Accessibility Standards
Area	CX Standard
Accessibility	
At a minimum, all CDR participants MUST seek to comply with the following accessibility guidelines throughout the Consent Model.

These standards SHOULD be assessed, tested, and refined further by accessibility consultants directly involved in implementation.

Accessibility
Content distinction	Data Recipients and Data Holders MUST seek to have all aspects of the Consent Model comply with WCAG 1.4. This will make it easier to see and hear content, including separate foreground information from the background.
Accessibility
Keyboard functionality	Data Recipients and Data Holders MUST seek to have all aspects of the Consent Model comply with WCAG 2.1. This will make all functionality available from a keyboard.
Accessibility
Pointer interactions	Data Recipients and Data Holders MUST seek to have all aspects of the Consent Model comply with WCAG 2.5. This will make it easier to operate functionality using various input devices
Accessibility
Reading experiences	Data Recipients and Data Holders MUST seek to have all aspects of the Consent Model comply with WCAG 3.1. This will make text content readable and understandable
Accessibility
Input assistance	Data Recipients and Data Holders MUST seek to have all aspects of the Consent Model comply with WCAG 3.3. This will help users avoid and correct mistakes.
Consent Standards
Area	CX Standard
Disclosure consent:
Collection source	In the course of seeking a consumer’s consent to disclose data as part of a disclosure consent:
Data Recipients MUST specify which CDR Participant(s) they collected the associated CDR data from
Data Recipients SHOULD specify the sector(s) the data was collected from or associated with
Note:
Point (1) only requires the Data Recipient to refer to the CDR Participant(s) immediately preceding them in the disclosure chain, which may not always include a consumer’s Data Holder(s)
This standard is proposed to apply to all data to be disclosed by a Data Recipient, including unmodified, aggregated, derived, and transformed CDR data
Where applicable, the existing data language standards apply to descriptions of CDR data that have not been modified
Disclosure Consent: Descriptions of Data to be Collected and Disclosed	If:
An accredited person is seeking a collection consent to collect CDR data from a particular accredited data recipient; or
An accredited data recipient is seeking a disclosure consent from a consumer to disclose CDR data;
and the data subject to the disclosure or collection is not within the data language standards as it does not relate to a relevant data cluster, then that data MUST be described in language that is as easy to understand as practicable.
Consent:
Redirection	Data recipients MUST notify consumers of redirection prior to authentication.
Authentication Standards
Area	CX Standard
Authentication:
'One Time Password' (OTP)	
Data Holders and Data Recipients MUST clearly refer to a "One Time Password" in consumer-facing interactions and communications.

The use of the term "One Time Password" MAY be presented alongside an existing term used by a data holder (e.g. Netcode, one time pin etc.).

Authentication:
Passwords	Data Holders and Data Recipients MUST state in consumer-facing interactions and communications that services utilising the CDR do not need access to consumer passwords for the purposes of sharing data. The exact phrasing of this is at the discretion of the Data Holder and Data Recipient.
Authentication:
Password link	Data Holders MUST NOT include forgotten details links in redirect screens. The inclusion of such links is considered to increase the likelihood of phishing attacks.
Authentication:
OTP expiry	Data Holders MUST communicate the expiry period of the OTP to the consumer in the authentication flow.
Authorisation Standards
Area	CX Standard
Authorisation:
Account selection	Data holders MUST allow the consumer to select which of their accounts to share data from if the data request includes account-specific data and if there are multiple accounts available. The Data holder MAY omit this step if none of the data being requested is specific to an account (e.g. Saved Payees).
Authorisation:
Profile selection	
Data holders MAY add a 'profile selection' step or equivalent prior to the account selection step if a single identifier provides access to different customer accounts. For example, one customer ID may give access to business customer and individual customer accounts.

The 'profile selection' step SHOULD only be considered if it is an existing customer experience, and SHOULD be as minimal as possible to avoid introducing unwarranted friction (having regard to CDR Rule 4.24).

Unavailable Accounts:
Displaying accounts	
If certain accounts are unavailable to share, data holders SHOULD show these unavailable accounts in the account-selection step.

Data holders SHOULD communicate why these accounts cannot be selected, and this SHOULD be communicated as in-line help or as a modal to reduce on-screen content.

Data holders MAY provide instructions on how to make these accounts available to share, and this SHOULD be communicated as in-line help or as a modal to reduce on-screen content.

Note: Unavailable accounts are to be interpreted in accordance with the rules on eligible consumers and required consumer data.

Unavailable Accounts:
No accounts can be shown	If unavailable accounts cannot be shown in the account selection step, data holders MAY display a generic explanation and instructions.
Unavailable Accounts:
Authorisation not permitted	If a successfully authenticated user cannot proceed to establish an authorisation in accordance with the rules on eligible consumers and required consumer data, data holders MAY provide the option of concluding the authorisation process.
Unavailable Accounts:
Request sharing rights	If a user does not have sharing rights for a particular account or set of accounts, data holders MAY invite the user to request sharing rights from the authorisation flow. The presentation of this mechanism MUST NOT introduce unwarranted friction as defined in rule 4.24 on restrictions.
Authorisation:
Account confirm	Data holders MUST show which accounts the data is being shared from prior to confirming authorisation if the data request includes account-specific data. The data holder MAY omit this information if none of the data being requested is specific to an account (e.g. Saved Payees).
Amending Authorisation Standards
Area	CX Standard
Authorisation:
Amending consent	Effective from November 2021:
The following standards apply when a Data Holder invites a CDR consumer to amend a current authorisation as per rule 4.22A and the ADR has supplied a cdr_arrangement_id:
Customer Profile	Where customer profile selection applies, Data Holders SHOULD omit the profile selection step and assume the customer profile associated with the existing authorisation. Data Holders MAY indicate which profile the authorisation relates to during the authorisation process.
Account Selection	Where account selection applies, Data Holders MUST pre-select accounts that were associated with the previous authorisation provided these accounts remain eligible and available to share. Data Holders MAY allow these accounts to be amended, and MAY provide information regarding the pre-selection of accounts.
Changing Attributes	Data Holders MUST indicate where a dataset is being added to an authorisation or a disclosure duration is being amended. Data Holders MAY apply this standard to other changing attributes, but this MUST ONLY apply where the attribute in the new authorisation differs to that of the previous authorisation. How a changed attributed is signified is at the Data Holder’s discretion.

Refer also to Future Dated obligations

Withdrawal Standards
Area	CX Standard
Withdrawing consent	If a Data Recipient does not have a general policy to delete redundant data, and the consumer has not already requested that their redundant data be deleted:
Data Recipients MUST allow consumers to elect to have their redundant data deleted as part of the withdrawal process prior to the final withdrawal step.
Data Recipients SHOULD consider prompting consumers to exercise this right at appropriate times (e.g. when inaction on the part of the consumer may cause them to lose the opportunity to exercise the right to delete their redundant data).
Withdrawing authorisation:
Consequences	As part of the withdrawal process, the data holder MUST advise the consumer to review the consequences of withdrawal with the Data Recipient before they stop sharing their data.
The data holder MAY consider using or paraphrasing the following message(s):
'You should check with [Data Recipient] before you stop sharing to understand the consequences.'
'You should check with [Data Recipient] to see if your service will be impacted before you stop sharing.'
Withdrawing authorisation:
Redundant data	As part of the withdrawal process, the data holder MUST inform the consumer about the handling of redundant data and the right to delete. The Data Holder MAY consider using or paraphrasing the following message(s):
'CDR data is either deleted or de-identified when it is no longer required.'
'[Data Recipient] will have specific policies on how to handle your data once it's no longer required.'
Withdrawal: Disclosure consent	As part of the disclosure consent withdrawal process, Data Recipients MUST advise the consumer to review, with the recipient that the data was disclosed to:
How their data will be handled; and
The consequences of withdrawing the disclosure consent
Note: The precise wording of the withdrawal message is at the discretion of the ADR
Withdrawal:
Secondary User Instruction	As part of the secondary user instruction withdrawal process, data holders MUST advise the consumer:
That removing a secondary user instruction will stop all current and future data sharing for the secondary user(s)
To review the consequences of withdrawal with the secondary user(s) before removing the secondary user instruction
Note: The exact phrasing of this message is at the discretion of the data holder.

CDR Federation
The CDR Federation will facilitate the secure exchange of consumer data and federation metadata between multiple system entities which will assume one or more of the following roles:

Data Holder:
Multiple Data Holders will be supported.
Data Recipient:
Multiple Data Recipients will be supported.
Software Product:
Multiple Software Products will be supported for each Data Recipient.
Register:
A register will be supported and will be maintained by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) acting in its capacity as the Registrar for the CDR.
Customer:
The authorising customer that is authenticated by a Data Holder.
Data Holder
The Data Holder (DH) is a system entity that authenticates a Customer (resource owner or user), as part of an authorisation process initiated by a Data Recipient, and issues an authorisation for that Data Recipient to access the Customer's data via published APIs.

A Data Holder assumes the role of an [OIDC] OpenID Provider.

For the purposes of this standard a single designated organisation may be represented via the Register as multiple separate Data Holders to support multiple brands or market identities.

Secondary Data Holder
A Secondary Data Holder (SDH) is a system entity that is designated to provide CDR data but does so via a standard Data Holder acting as a gateway. A Secondary Data Holder does not interact directly with Data Recipients and is not registered with the Register.

A request for data from a Secondary Data Holder by a standard Data Holder is known as a Secondary Responsibility Request.

See the Secondary Responsibility section contains standards related to Secondary Data Holders and Secondary Responsibility Requests.

Data Recipient
A Data Recipient (DR) is a system entity that is accredited to collect CDR data from Data Holders or other DRs through authorised Software Products.

A Data Recipient MUST be accredited in order to participate in the CDR Federation. Accreditation rules for Data Recipients are beyond the scope of this artefact. The process of accreditation is managed by the CDR Registrar.

For the purposes of this standard a single accredited organisation is represented via the Register as a single Data Recipient and may be represented by multiple separate Software Products to support multiple applications or services.

Software Product
A Data Recipient Software Product (DRSP) is a system entity that is authorised by a Data Holder to access consumer resources (APIs). A Software Product MUST capture consumer consent prior to commencing an authorisation process with a Data Holder.

A Software Product MUST be registered with the Registrar and approved for use in order to participate in the CDR Federation.

A Software Product MAY be registered for use across one or more sectors (e.g. banking and energy).

A Software Product assumes the role of an [OIDC] Relying Party (Client).

Register
The Register is a central point of discovery for both Data Holders and Data Recipients. Data Holders and Data Recipients must be created as entities in the Register in order for them to participate as members of the CDR Federation. The functionality of the Register will include but will not be limited to:

Management of Identities and Access: The Register will allow registered persons, on behalf of Data Holders and Data Recipients, to manage the metadata of their associated organisations and systems.
Management of Certificates: The Register will facilitate the issuing, management and revocation of digital certificates.
Discoverability and Search: The Register will expose APIs and Web Interfaces in order to support metadata queries across Register entities.
Customer
For the purposes of this standard a single person or individual may be represented as multiple Customers according to the practice of the Data Holder according to their existing digital channels.

Authentication Flows
This profile supports the authentication flows specified by OpenID Connect [OIDC] as constrained further by FAPI [FAPI].

Specifically the Hybrid Flow outlined at section 3.3 of [OIDC].

No other flows are currently supported.


OIDC Hybrid Flow
The [OIDC] Hybrid Flow is a type of redirection flow where the consumer's user agent is redirected from a Data Recipient Software Product’s (Relying Party) web site to a Data Holder’s Authorisation end point in the context of an [OIDC] authentication request. The Hybrid flow incorporates aspects of the both the implicit flow and authorisation code flow detailed under [OIDC].

Only a response_type (see section 3 of [OIDC]) of code id_token SHALL be allowed.

The request_uri parameter is only supported if the Data Holder supports PAR.

In addition, the following statements are applicable for this flow:

Data Holders MUST request a user identifier that can uniquely identify the customer and that is already known by the customer in the redirected page
Data Holders MUST NOT request that the customer enter an existing password in the redirected page
Data Holders MUST provide a one-time password (OTP) to the customer through an existing channel or mechanism that the customer can then enter into the redirected page
The delivery mechanism for the OTP is at the discretion of the Data Holder but MUST align to existing and preferred channels for the customer and MUST NOT introduce unwarranted friction into the authentication process
Data Holders SHOULD implement additional controls to minimise the risk of interception of the OTP through the selected delivery mechanism
The provided OTP MUST be used only for authentication for CDR based sharing and MUST NOT be usable for the authorisation of other transactions or actions
The provided OTP MUST be invalidated after a period of time at the discretion of the Data Holder. This expiry period SHOULD facilitate enough time for the customer to reasonably complete the authorisation process
The provided OTP MUST be numeric digits and be between 4 and 6 digits in length
The algorithm for the creation of the OTP is at the discretion of the Data Holder but SHOULD incorporate a level of pseudorandomness appropriate for the use case
Data Holders SHOULD implement additional controls to minimise the risk of enumeration attacks via the redirect page
Data Recipient Software Products SHOULD record the following information each time an authorisation flow is executed: username (consumer’s ID at the Data Recipient Software Product), timestamp, IP, consent scopes and duration.
In line with CDR Rule 4.24 on restrictions when asking CDR consumers to authorise disclosure of CDR data, unwarranted friction for OTP delivery is considered to include:

the addition of any requirements beyond normal data holder practices for verification code delivery
providing or requesting additional information beyond normal data holder practices for verification code delivery
offering additional or alternative services
reference or inclusion of other documents
Additional requirements and guidelines for this flow are contained in the Consumer Experience section.


Client Authentication
This section outlines how participants in the CDR regime will authenticate clients seeking access to end points.

Note that, while [MTLS] is utilised for transaction security and as a Holder of Key mechanism, the PKI Mutual TLS OAuth Client Authentication Method SHALL NOT be supported as the mechanism for client authentication.

The following authentication methods are supported:

Data Holders SHALL authenticate the CDR Register client using one of the following Client Authentication methods:

Self-signed JWT client assertion authenticated by the protected request endpoint according to Self-signed JWT Client Authentication, or
private_key_jwt authentication using client_credentials authorisation grant flow according to Private Key JWT Client Authentication.

Authorisation Servers supporting private_key_jwt Client Authentication of clients MUST support the following requirements:

Authorisation Servers MUST support the authentication of clients using the private_key_jwt Client Authentication method specified at section 9 of [OIDC].
The private_key_jwt authentication method is enabled through the delivery of an encoded [JWT] signed using the Data Recipient Software Product's private key and thus facilitates non-repudiation.
Client public keys are obtained from the [JWKS] endpoints.
For the client authentication assertion, the [JWT] represents an assertion that MUST contain the following REQUIRED Claim Values and MAY contain the following OPTIONAL Claim Values:

iss - REQUIRED. Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. The client ID of the bearer.
sub - REQUIRED. Subject Identifier. The client ID of the bearer.
aud - REQUIRED. Audience(s) that the JWT is intended for. The issuer identifier URL of the authorisation server according to [RFC8414] SHOULD be used as the value of the audience. In order to facilitate interoperability, the authorisation server MUST accept its Issuer Identifier, Token Endpoint URL, or the URI of the endpoint being invoked as values that identify it as an intended audience.
jti - REQUIRED. JWT ID. A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used once.
exp - REQUIRED. Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. Value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC expiry time.
iat - OPTIONAL. Time at which the JWT was issued. Value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC issued at time.
The aforementioned assertion MUST be sent to the Authorisation Server's Token endpoint with the POST method and MUST include the following REQUIRED parameters and MAY contain the following OPTIONAL parameters:

grant_type - REQUIRED. The grant type(s) supported by the Authorisation Server.
client_id - REQUIRED. The client ID of the bearer.
client_assertion_type - REQUIRED. This MUST be set to urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer.
client_assertion - REQUIRED. The encoded assertion JWT.
scope - OPTIONAL. The requested scope as described in Section 3.3 of [RFC6749].
Self-signed JWT Client Authentication
Self-signed JWT Client Authentication Non-Normative Example - CDR Register calls the Data holder's Get Metrics end point using self-signed JWT Client Authentication (note that the “aud” claim represents the AdminBaseUri as defined in CDR Register Participant Endpoints).

GET https://admin.data.holder.com.au/cds-au/v1/admin/metrics HTTP:/1.1

}
Data Recipient Software Products and Data Holders supporting the self-signed JWT authentication of clients using a signed JWT MUST do so according to the following requirements:

The JWT MUST contain the following REQUIRED Claim Values and MAY contain the following OPTIONAL Claim Values:

iss - REQUIRED. Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. The client ID of the bearer.
sub - REQUIRED. Subject Identifier. The client ID of the bearer.
aud - REQUIRED. Audience(s) that the JWT is intended for. The Data Holder or Data Recipient Software Product MUST verify that it is an intended audience for the token. Contents MUST be the "resource path" for the end point being accessed.
jti - REQUIRED. JWT ID. A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used once.
exp - REQUIRED. Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. Value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC expiry time.
iat - OPTIONAL. Time at which the JWT was issued. Value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC issued at time.
Validation and use of the JWT and the claims described above MUST be performed in accordance with [JWT].

The JWT MUST be accepted from the client at the requested endpoint using the "Authorization Request Header Field" mechanism as described in section 2.1 of [RFC6750].

CDR Register calling Data Holders
Data Holders MUST support either Private Key JWT Client Authentication or Self-signed JWT Client Authentication of the CDR Register.

Data Holders SHOULD support Private Key JWT Client Authentication but MAY support Self-signed JWT Client Authentication.

This method MAY be changed by updating Data Holder registration details with the CDR Register.

Private Key JWT authentication
If the Data Holder supports the Private Key JWT Client Authentication method for authenticating the CDR Register, it MUST also support the following requirements:

Data Holders MUST issue a client ID that is provided to the CDR Register. The client ID is issued to the CDR Register during out of band registration processes, including, Data Holder onboarding. This MAY be a static client ID value of ‘cdr-register’.
The authorisation grant's grant_type parameter MUST be set to client_credentials.
The authorisation grant's scope parameter MUST be provided and MUST be set to the scope of the resource endpoint to be accessed.
Upon successful authentication, Data Holders MUST issue an Access Token to the CDR Register. In accordance with section 4.4 of [RFC6749] an Refresh Token SHOULD NOT be included.
Self-signed JWT authentication
If the Data Holder supports the Self-signed JWT Client Authentication method for authenticating the CDR Register, the client ID MUST be set to a value of cdr-register.

Data Holders calling Data Recipients
Non-Normative Example - Data Holder calls the Data Recipient Software Product's revocation end point (note that the "aud" claim is "resource path" to the revocation end point).

POST https://data.recipient.com.au/revocation HTTP/1.1
Host: data.recipient.com.au

Client Registration
Dynamic Client Registration
Data Recipients register with Data Holders according to [DCR] to obtain client credentials used to retrieve consumer data on behalf of a consumer.

Software Statement Assertion (SSA)
As per [DCR], a Software Statement is defined in as: A digitally signed JSON Web Token (JWT) created in accordance with [JWT] that asserts metadata values about the client software

An SSA is a digitally signed JSON Web Token (JWT) created in accordance with [JWT] that asserts metadata values about the client software.

Such that:

The CDR Register MUST issue Software Statements to active Data Recipients for active Software Products
The CDR Register MUST issue distinct Software Statements for each Software Product ID
Software Statements are issued with a 10 minute expiry time
As per [FAPI-RW], SSAs are signed by the CDR Register using PS256
CDR Register public keys are exposed on a dedicated JWKS URI endpoint
The CDR Register JWKS is an unauthenticated endpoint, using TLS
Data Recipients MUST present a valid SSA when undertaking dynamic client registration
Data Holders MUST NOT register Data Recipient software products unless they present a verified Registration Request with a verified SSA
Refer to the Register APIs section for the endpoint definitions that will be used to retrieve and validate SSAs.

The Software Statement value MUST be returned unmodified. Client metadata elements used from the software statement MUST also be returned directly as top-level client metadata values in the registration response.

Any additional claims MUST be ignored and not returned on completion of the request.

Registration Errors
Example Error Response

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{
 "error": "invalid_software_statement",
 "error_description": "Duplicate registrations for a given software_id are not valid"
}
When an error condition occurs during a registration request, the response MUST be returned to the Accredited Data Recipient conforming to Section 3.2.2 of [DCR].

Duplicate registrations are not permitted so attempts to create a registration which already exists MUST return an HTTP 400 error.

Registration error responses schemas are defined in the DCR APIs section.

For those Registration errors which do not map to Section 3.2.2 of [DCR], HTTP Response Codes in the Consumer Data Standards should be used.

Data Holders MUST expose Client Registration Management endpoints as defined in the DCR APIs

HTTP Verb		MTLS	HoK	Client Authentication
POST /register	Required			N/A
GET /register/{clientID}	Required			Client Credentials with cdr:registration scope
PUT /register/{clientID}	Required			Client Credentials with cdr:registration scope
DELETE /register/{clientID}	Optional			Client Credentials with cdr:registration scope
Registration endpoints will be exposed in the OIDC Discovery Configuration Endpoint
POST and PUT operations MUST accept the SSA payload.
Fields data holders do not support are not persisted.
Access tokens issued for consuming CDR Data should not be used for client registration maintenance and vice-versa
PUT Operations
Registrations MUST only be updated via Registration PUT operations

PUT operations are to be used for one of two scenarios:

The client has updated their registration details on the CDR Register and updates this information to the data holder
A new version of the SSA has been released and the client updates this information to the data holder
Participant Statuses
Data Recipient and Software Product Statuses
The accreditation status of Data Recipients, and the status of their associated Software Products, may traverse through multiple statuses in the CDR.

The status of participants is maintained in the CDR Register by the CDR Registrar according to determination of the CDR Accreditor or the participant themselves.

CDR data may only be disclosed to active Data Recipients. Data Holders MUST cease disclosing CDR data where the accreditation of a Data Recipient or Software Package is:

Suspended or revoked by the CDR Registrar.
Surrendered by the Data Recipient.
The CDR Register MUST notify all Data Holders of the above changes in Data Recipient and Software Package status via the Register APIs.

The CDR Register MUST expose the statuses of data recipients and their associated software products via the Register APIs, using the following state models:

Data Recipient Status


Software Product Status


Status Mapping
When the CDR Registrar changes the accreditation status for a Data Recipient for any status other than active, the associated Software Product statuses MUST be changed accordingly.

The cascading status mappings are as follows:

Data Recipient Status	Cascaded Software Product Status
Suspended	Inactive
Revoked	Removed
Surrendered	Removed
Archiving
Dormant entries will be identified and archived automatically within the CDR Register.

Dormant entries are defined as those records that have reached and maintained an end state in the CDR Register for the past 2 years.

The table below outlines the end state for each Register entry type:

Register Entity	End State
Data Holder	Removed
Data Holder Brand	Removed
Data Recipient	Surrendered, Revoked
Data Recipient Brand	Removed
Data Recipient Software Product	Removed
Data Holder Responsibilities
The CDR Registrar has the ability to change the status of a Software Product independently of the Data Recipient's accreditation status. Therefore, both the Data Recipient and Software Product statuses should be referenced, to determine the Data Holder's responsibilities for data disclosure, consent and registration management.

Data Recipient
Status	Software Product
Status	Disclose of CDR Data	Facilitate Consent Authorisation	Facilitate Consent Withdrawal	Invalidate Consents	Cleanup Registration
Active	Active					
Active	Inactive					
Active	Removed					
Suspended	Inactive					
Suspended	Removed					
Revoked	Removed					
Surrendered	Removed					
Disclosure of CDR data MUST be in response to valid requests in accordance with the CDR rules and standards
The status of a Data Recipient Brand does not impact Data Holder responsibilities due to the cascade rules outlined above
When a Data Recipient status is Suspended, Revoked or Surrendered the Software Product status cannot be Active
Invalidation of consents and cleanup of registrations are bulk operations. It is reasonable to execute these as batch tasks performed overnight
Metadata Cache Management
Data Holders MUST react to Data Recipient and associated Software Statuses changes within 5 minutes of the change occurring on the CDR Register.

To achieve this, Data Holders will poll the GetDataRecipientsStatus, GetSoftwareProductsStatus and GetDataRecipients APIs to retrieve the current statuses and cache these for use during requests for Consumer Data.

Data Holders MUST choose a frequency of polling which ensures their systems can respond to status changes within the required timeframe.

Data Holders and Data Recipients MUST cache all other participant data they use and periodically update this cache using a slow poll. This ensures that changes to participant configuration propagates throughout the ecosystem in a predictable timeframe.

The CDR Register MAY cache the responses for public APIs hosted by the CDR Register. If caching is supported the CDR Register MUST support ETag cache validators allowing participants to detect whether the content has changed.

Cache update periods
The following are the recommended caching times for data retrieved from the Register APIs.

API	Type	Period
GetDataRecipientsStatus	Public	2-5 minutes
GetSoftwareProductsStatus	Public	2-5 minutes
GetDataRecipients (statuses)	Public	2-5 minutes
GetDataRecipients (other data)	Public	6 hours
GetDataHolderBrands	Private	6 hours
OIDC Client Types
Only Confidential Clients SHALL be supported under this profile. Therefore, Public clients SHALL NOT be supported.

In reference to the client types referenced in section 2.1 of [OAUTH2]:

Confidential Clients MUST be supported under this profile.
Public clients MUST NOT be supported.
JSON Web Key Sets
Data Holder public keys MUST only be obtained from the standard OIDC end point used for that purpose.

Data Recipient Software Product public keys MUST only be obtained from the URI registered with the CDR Register.

CDR Register public keys MUST only be obtained from the end point exposed for that purpose.


Consent
Consent requirements will be communicated between the Data Recipient Software Product and Data Holder via the authorisation request object. The primary mechanism for capturing consent will be scopes and claims under [OIDC].

Other patterns for the establishment of consent may be considered in the future, including the incorporation of fine-grained consent for specific use cases.

Scopes and Claims
OIDC Scopes
In addition to CDR data scopes the following scopes MUST be supported:

openid: As described as section 3.1.2.1 of [OIDC], this scope MUST be present on each authentication request.
profile: Data Holders MUST support the profile scope as described in section 5.4 of [OIDC]. This scope MAY be present on an authentication request.
Claims
The following normal [OIDC] claims MUST be supported. This list includes, but is not limited to, [OIDC] standard claims :

sub: Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) for the End-User at the Data Holder.
acr: Authentication Context Class Reference. MUST contain a valid ordinal LoA value.
auth_time: Time when the End-User authentication occurred. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC auth_time. It MUST be returned by the Data Holder in the ID Token when the Data Recipient Software Product has requested it as an essential claim according to section 2 of the [OIDC] standard. It SHOULD NOT be returned via the UserInfo endpoint.
name: End-User's full name in displayable form including all name parts.
given_name: Given name(s) or first name(s) of the End-User.
family_name: Surname(s) or last name(s) of the End-User.
updated_at: Time the End-User's information was last updated. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC updated_at time.
The following additional claims MUST be supported:

refresh_token_expires_at: indicates the date-time at which the most recently provided refresh token will expire. Its value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value, as specified in section 2 of section 2 [JWT]. If no refresh token has been provided then a zero value should be returned.
sharing_expires_at: indicates the date-time at which the current sharing arrangement will expire. Its value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value, as specified in section 2 of [JWT]. If consent is not complete or a sharing_duration was not requested in the authorisation request object then a zero value should be returned.

  "refresh_token_expires_at": 1311281970,
  "sharing_expires_at": 1311281970
}
ID Tokens are specified in section 2 of the [OIDC] standard. In accordance with [FAPI-RW], ID Tokens must be signed and encrypted when returned to a Data Recipient Software Product from both the Authorisation End Point and Token End Point.

In addition to the mandatory claims specified in section 2 of the [OIDC] standard, required claims for ID Tokens as part of Hybrid Flow authentication must align to section 3.3 (Authentication using the Hybrid Flow) of the [OIDC] standards and section 5.2.2 and section 8.4.3 of the [FAPI-RW] profile.

ID Tokens MUST be signed by Data Holders as specified in section 8.6 of [FAPI-RW].

The ID Token returned from the Authorisation End Point MUST NOT contain any Personal Information (PI) claims.

Hashing value for state and authorisation code
The c_hash value MUST be generated according to section 3.3.2.11 of [OIDC].

The s_hash value MUST be generated according to section 5.1 of [FAPI-RW].

Access Token
Access Tokens MUST be used as specified in section 10.3 of [OAUTH2].

An Access Token MUST expire between 2 minutes to 10 minutes after the Data Holder issues it (at the discretion of the Data Holder).

The process for refreshing an Access Token is described in section 12.1 of [OIDC].

Refresh Token
Refresh Tokens MUST be supported by Data Holders.

The usage of Refresh Tokens is specified in section 12 of [OIDC].

The expiration time for a Refresh Token MUST be set by the Data Holder.

Refresh Token expiration MAY be any length of time greater than 28 days but MUST NOT exceed the end of the duration of sharing consented to by the Consumer.

Data Holders MAY cycle Refresh Tokens when an Access Token is issued. If Refresh Token cycling is not performed then the Refresh Token MUST NOT expire before the expiration of the sharing consented by the Customer.

Token Expiry
The expiry time for issued access tokens and refresh tokens must be deterministic for the Data Recipient Software Product.

In order to achieve this:

The Data Holder MUST indicate the lifetime in seconds of the access token in the expires_in field of the JSON object returned by the token end-point (see section 4.2.2 of [OAUTH2]).
The Data Holder MUST indicate the expiration time of the refresh token using the refresh_token_expires_at claim.

Identifiers and Subject Types
sub claim
The identifier for an authenticated end-user (subject) MUST be passed in the sub claim of an ID Token and UserInfo response as defined by [OIDC].

The Data Holder MUST generate the sub value as a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as described in section 8 of [OIDC]. Furthermore, the identifier MUST be unique per customer as per the definition of customer in the CDR Federation section of this profile.

The Data Holder MUST support the sector_identifier_uri in PPID generation according to [OIDC] if this field was supplied by the client during registration.

It is RECOMMENDED that the sub value is generated as a version 4 Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [RFC4122].

}
The CDR Arrangement ID is a unique string representing a consent arrangement between a Data Recipient Software Product and Data Holder for a given consumer.

The identifier MUST be unique per customer according to the definition of customer in the CDR Federation section of this profile.

The Data Holder MUST provide the CDR Arrangement ID as the claim cdr_arrangement_id in the Token End Point response and Token Introspection End Point response.

A Data Holder MUST only return the cdr_arrangement_id in the Token and Token Introspection End Point responses if they also support concurrent consent. This ensures that Data Recipient Software Products have a reliable way to determine whether a given Data Holder supports concurrent consent.

Statements related to the CDR Arrangement ID:

The CDR Arrangement ID MUST be unique to a Data Holder
The CDR Arrangement ID MUST be non-guessable and must not identify a consumer
A CDR Arrangement ID SHOULD be generated using an algorithm that reduces the chances of collision
A CDR Arrangement ID MUST be static across consents within the one sharing arrangement (e.g. across consent renewal and re-authorisation)
Obtaining a CDR Arrangement ID
For any existing consents, Data Holders must retrospectively generate a cdr_arrangement_id such that Data Recipient Software Products can obtain a valid cdr_arrangement_id for all active consents they hold.

A Data Recipient Software Product can call either the Token or Token Introspection End Points at any point post-consent to obtain the CDR Arrangement ID in the response JSON as the claim cdr_arrangement_id.

Levels of Assurance (LoAs)
Levels Of Assurance (LoAs), returned after a successful authentication MUST be represented in Single Ordinal form where a single LoA value is represented.


Single Ordinal
A Single LoA value is carried in the acr claim which is described in section 2 of [OIDC].

An LoA of 2 is represented by the URI: urn:cds.au:cdr:2

The authenticator used to attain this level MUST conform with the Credential Level CL1 rules specified under the Trusted Digital Identity Framework [TDIF] Authentication Credential Requirements specification.
An LoA of 3 is represented by the URI: urn:cds.au:cdr:3

The authenticators used to attain this level MUST conform with the Credential Level CL2 rules specified under the Trusted Digital Identity Framework [TDIF] Authentication Credential Requirements specification.
READ operations SHALL only be allowed where at least an LoA of 2 has been achieved during the establishment of consent.

WRITE operations SHALL only be allowed where:

At least an LoA of 3 has been achieved during the establishment of consent, or
At least an LoA of 2 has been achieved during the establishment of consent and a subsequent challenge/response has resulted in an LoA of 3 being achieved within the lifespan of the current Access Token.
Transaction Security
Use of TLS
All HTTP calls MUST be made using HTTPS incorporating TLS >= 1.2.


Use of MTLS
All back-channel communication between Data Recipient Software Product and Data Holder systems MUST incorporate, unless stated otherwise, [MTLS] as part of the TLS handshake:

The presented Client transport certificate MUST be issued by the CDR Certificate Authority (CA). The Server MUST NOT trust Client transport certificates issued by other authorities.
The presented Server transport certificate MUST be issued by the CDR Certificate Authority (CA). The Client MUST NOT trust Server transport certificates issued by other authorities.
End points for transferring CDR Data that are classified as not requiring authentication do not require the use of [MTLS].

Holder of Key Mechanism
[MTLS] MUST be supported as a Holder of Key (HoK) Mechanism.

Note that, by implication, resource requests MUST be validated to ensure the client certificate and access token match.

OAUTB SHALL NOT be supported due to a lack industry support.

[MTLS] HoK allows issued tokens to be bound to a client certificate as specified in section 3 of [MTLS].

Ciphers
Only the following cipher suites SHALL be permitted in accordance with section 8.5 of [FAPI-RW]:

TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Certificate Management

- Resource endpoints
- InfoSec endpoints
- Admin endpoints	It will be up to the DH on how these endpoints are segregated. They may all be on the one domain (so only one certificate required) or could be separated.
Issued by the Register CA for Data Recipients
Certificate	Function	Notes
Client Certificate	Secures the following:
- Consuming Register APIs
- Consuming Data Holder APIs	
Server Certificate(s)	Certificate is issued to a FQDN.
Secures the following:
- Revocation endpoint
- CDR Arrangement Management endpoint
- JWKS endpoint	ADRs may choose to secure their endpoints with an the Register CA issued certificate or a certificate issued by a public CA.
CDR Certificate Authority
DigiCert acts as the certificate authority that issues and manages certificates to CDR participants as directed by the the Register in its capacity as the CDR Registrar.

Certificate Trust Model
The CDR utilises a private certificate trust chain for all Register CA secured endpoints being hosted by Data Holders, Data Recipients and the Register.

This trust chain encompasses a set of root and intermediate CAs issued for the test and production environments.

Test Environment	CA Root Test
CA Intermediate Test
Production Environment	CA Root Production
CA Intermediate Production
Certificate Signing Request Profile
When requesting the Register CA certificates, certificate signing requests will need to be provided, conforming to the following profile:

CSR Field	Server	Client
Common Name	Primary DNS Name
e.g. api1.test.entity.com	Software Product Name OR
Brand Name
SAN (Optional)	Secondary DNS Name(s)
e.g. api2.test.entity.com	N/A
Organization	Brand Name (Legal Entity Name)	Brand Name (Legal Entity Name)
Organizational Unit	Consumer Data Right	Consumer Data Right
Country	Country of participant
e.g. AU	Country of participant
e.g. AU
Signature Algorithm	SHA256	SHA256
Key Algorithm	RSA	RSA
Key Size	2048	2048
Please refer to the Register onboarding guide for further information on certificate issuance.

Certificate Usage
Further details on the Register CA issued certificates can be found in the ACCC Certificate Practice Statement V1.0.

Certificate Validation
Certificate validation must check:

1. Checking for certificate validity

Verify private key signature is mathematically linked to the presented public key certificate, presented certificate identifies trusted User/Application and/or Service and certificate is both valid and not revoked.

2. Issuer‐to‐subject name chaining

Signatures from Issuing CA’s and associated CA public key certificates are trusted, valid and not revoked.

3. Policy and key use constraints

Each certificate has the applicable and appropriate x.509 certificate extensions, e.g. CA and CRL signing, Digital Signing, Client and Server Authentication, etc.

4. Revocation Status

Status is checked through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders, identified in each certificate in the chain.

The Certificate Practice Statement provides details for DigiCert's certificate validation requirements and a summary has been provided in the CDR Support Portal article: Certificate Validation.

OCSP stapling
The use of OCSP Stapling within the CDR ecosystem is not recommended.

CORS
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) must be enabled (ie. Access-Control-Allow-Origin set to "*") for the following end points:

Get Status
Get Outages
Get Products
Get Product Detail

}
The Request Object is a signed and encoded JWT specified in section 6.1 of [OIDC]. As per [FAPI-RW] section 5.2.2, the request parameter MUST be present on requests to the [OIDC] Hybrid Authorisation End Point. The Request Object enables [OIDC] requests to be passed in a single and self-contained parameter.

Request Objects MUST be signed by Data Recipient Software Products as specified in section 8.6 of [FAPI-RW].

Request Object references MUST be supported if the Data Holder supports Pushed Authorisation Requests (PAR).

Requesting Sharing Duration
To facilitate the specification of the duration for consent to share CDR data that is approved by the consumer, a mechanism for the Data Recipient Software Product to specify a sharing duration to the Data Holder is required.

To accomplish this, the Data Holder MUST support an additional claim in the authorisation request object named sharing_duration. The sharing_duration claim MUST be handled as follows:

The sharing_duration parameter is a number
The value of the sharing_duration parameter will contain the requested duration for sharing, in seconds.
If the sharing_duration value exceeds one year then a duration of one year will be assumed.
If the sharing_duration value is less than or equal to 24 hours, then one-time collection will be assumed, and a Refresh Token should be provided by the Data Holder
If the sharing_duration value is zero or absent then once off access will be assumed and only an Access Token (without a Refresh Token) will be provided on successful authorisation.
If a Refresh Token is issued for one-time collection the Data Recipient Software Product must call the Data Holder’s revocation endpoint after successful collection of the CDR data.
If the sharing_duration value is negative then the authorisation should fail.
Note that the period of one year in the above statements should be interpreted as 365, 24 hour days (or 31,536,000 seconds).

The Data Recipient Software Product is able to obtain the expiration of sharing via the sharing_expires_at claim.

Specifying an existing arrangement
Provided a Data Holder supports PAR, they MUST also support the cdr_arrangement_id claim provided in the Request Object sent to the PAR End Point. The Data Recipient Software Product MAY provide the cdr_arrangement_id claim in the Request Object sent to the PAR End Point.

If a Data Recipient Software Product provides the cdr_arrangement_id claim in the request object to the Data Holder's PAR End Point, the Data Holder MUST revoke any existing tokens related to the arrangement once the new consent is successfully established and a new set of tokens has been provided to the Data Recipient Software Product.

Client Authentication Required	Yes
Bearer Token Required	No
Data Holders MUST support Pushed Authorisation Requests (PAR) via the pushed authorisation end point according to [PAR].

Data Recipient Software Products MAY send authorisation requests using [PAR] if supported by the Data Holder. Request objects which contain the cdr_arrangement_id claim MUST only be sent using [PAR]. If a Data Holder does not support [PAR], a Data Recipient Software Product SHOULD NOT provide the cdr_arrangement_id claim in the request object.

The Data Holder response provides the Data Recipient Software Product with a Request URI in the response. The Request URI is then passed to the Data Holder’s Authorisation End Point to initiate an authorisation flow.

In addition:

Request Object references SHALL NOT be supported in any mode of use other than [PAR]. If a Data Holder does not support [PAR], it MUST NOT support Request Object references.
The Request URI MUST expire between 10 seconds and 90 seconds
Data Recipient Software Products MAY provide an existing cdr_arrangement_id claim in an authorisation request object to establish a new consent under an existing arrangement
Data Holders MUST revoke existing refresh tokens and access tokens when a cdr_arrangement_id is provided in the Request Object but only after successful authorisation
If the cdr_arrangement_id is not related to the consumer being authenticated it MUST be rejected
If the cdr_arrangement_id is not recognised by to the Data Holder it MUST be rejected
Dynamic Client Registration Endpoints
Data Holders MUST expose the following endpoints in accordance with [DCR].

For more details of these endpoints see the DCR Apis section.

For additional statements on the operation of these endpoint during client registration see the Client Registration section.

HTTP Verb	Auth Server Support	TLS-MA	HoK	Grant Type	Access Token Scope
POST /register	Required			N/A	None
GET /register/{clientID}	Required			Client Credentials	cdr:registration
PUT /register/{clientID}	Required			Client Credentials	cdr:registration
DELETE /register/{clientID}	Optional			Client Credentials	cdr:registration
Additional statements regarding these endpoings:

During registration management requests, Data Holders MUST validate that the scope of access tokens provided includes cdr:registration
Registration requests and responses must conform to the specification in the DCR APIs section.
Any fields the Data Holder does not support MUST be ignored without error.
Registrations MUST only be updated via a PUT operation on the registration endpoint
POST and PUT operations MUST accept the SSA payload
Update (PUT) operations are to be used for one of two scenarios:
The client has updated their registration details on the CDR Register and updates this information to the data holder brands
A new version of the SSA has been released and the client updates this information to the data holder brands
Register Endpoints
The CDR Register exposes an OIDC Configuration Endpoint with associated JWKS and token endpoints to faciliate issuance of access tokens to consume the protected Register APIs.

Register APIs
This following provides an overview of the Register APIs for Data Holders and Data Recipients to collect participant metadata. These endpoints are exposed by the Register and consumed by Data Holders and Data Recipients.

 These endpoints are not implemented by Data Holders and Data Recipients. They are hosted by the Register for consumption by participants. Data Holders and Data Recipient Software Productss are required to call these endpoints to obtain metadata that enables connection and registration between participants as well as obtaining the status of participants in the CDR. These statuses are provided authoritatively by the Register to allow participants to determine whether a connecting third-party is permitted to perform registration requests or data sharing requests.

Non-functional Requirements
The non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the Consumer Data Right regime cover a number of considerations:

Minimum performance and availability expectations for data holders. Included to ensure a reliable and performant service is offered to Data Recipients and customers.
Maximum traffic expectations for data holders. Included to ensure there is a ceiling for the amount of traffic that a data holder is expected to service.
Requirements for reporting of performance. Included to provide transparency of performance without the need for time consuming auditing or inspection.
Requirements for data latency and quality. Included to give a clear indication to the depth and recency of the data available under the regime.
Limitations on the number of calls that a Data Recipient Software Product can make to a single provider. Included to protect data holders from poorly designed or overly transactional Data Recipient implementations.
Definitions
In the following definition of NFRs specific terms have the following meanings:

Data Recipient Software Product: For the purposes of these NFRs a Data Recipient Software Product is defined, inline with the definition given in the CDR Federation, as a configured application presented in the register meta data. This acknowledges that a single accredited entity may be able to register multiple independent services (or apps) that can obtain authorisations from consumers independently of each other.
Secondary Responsibility Request: A request made to a secondary data holder by a Data Holder for designated data to fulfil a Consumer Data Request made by a Data Recipient Software Product.
Session: A session is defined as the life span of a unique Access Token. Multiple API requests made with a single, valid, Access Token would be considered part of a single Session.
Customer Present: Authenticated API requests made in direct response to interactions by the end customer using the digital services of the Data Recipient Software Product will be considered “Customer Present”. Technically a data holder will define an API request as “Customer Present” if, and only if, the x-fapi-customer-ip-address header is populated with a valid IP address of the end customer’s device.
Customer Not Present: Authenticated API requests that are not deemed to be “Customer Present”
Unattended: A synonym of “Customer Not Present”
Authenticated: API requests to API end points that the standards require to be protected by security mechanisms that enforce explicit customer authorisation
Unauthenticated: API requests to API end points that the standards deem to be publicly available. This implies that these end points may be accessed by any client without the client performing any authentication or authorisation actions
High Traffic Period: Any time in the 18 hour period between 6am and 12am (midnight) is considered to be a high traffic period
Low Traffic Period: Any time of the day not considered to be included in a high traffic period.
Large Payload: An API which is capable of returning a large data response that would reasonably impose higher data retrieval times on the resource server. Typically bulk request end points.
Session Requirements
A expiry time of a unique session should be set according to the statements included in the Security Profile.

After a unique session is expired it is expected that the Data Recipient Software Product, for the same customer, may establish a new session as long as the authorisation is still valid.

Availability Requirements
Service availability requirement for data holders and secondary data holders: 99.5% per month

The definition of a period of unavailability is any period of time when any of the API end points defined in the standard is unable to reliably provide a successful response to an appropriately constructed request.

The availability requirement applies to both authenticated and unauthenticated end points.

The availability requirement does not include planned outages. Planned outages should be:

Commensurate in length and frequency to other primary digital channels offered by the data holder,
Published to Data Recipient Software Products with at least one week lead time for normal outages,
May occur without notification if the change is to resolve a critical service or security issue.
The unavailability of a secondary data holder will mean that some requests cannot be fulfilled by a data holder making a secondary responsibility request. This will not be taken to mean that the data holder is unavailable.

Performance Requirements
API end point performance will be measured in response time of individual API requests from receipt of request to delivery of response.

It is understood that different response times can be measured depending on which technical layer of an API implementation stack is instrumented and that not all of the technical layers between the Data Recipient Software Product and the Data Holder will be in the control of the Data Holder. As this is implementation specific it is expected that the Data Holder will ensure that the measurement of response time occurs as close to the Data Recipient Software Product as practicable.

In light of these considerations, the performance requirement for Data Holders is:

95% of calls per hour responded to within a nominated threshold

The nominated threshold for each end point will be according to the following table:

Tier	Response Time	Applies To…
Unauthenticated	1500ms	All Unauthenticated end points not otherwise specified in a separate threshold.
High Priority	1000ms	All calls to the following end points:

Get Bulk Usage
Get Usage For Service Point
Get Usage For Specific Service Points
Get Bulk DER
Get DER For Specific Service Points
Note that calls initiated in excess of a traffic threshold (see next section) may be excluded from the performance requirement.

Traffic Thresholds
Calls in excess of the following traffic thresholds will be able to be freely throttled or rejected by a data holder without impact to their performance or availability requirements.

Traffic thresholds will be set using the following metrics:

Number of sessions per day – the number of individual sessions initiated in a calendar day.
Transactions Per Second (TPS) – the number of concurrent transactions each second.
Number of calls – the number of end point calls initiated for a specified duration.
For Customer Present and authorisation traffic the following traffic thresholds will apply:

Unlimited sessions per day
10 TPS per customer
50 TPS per Data Recipient Software Product
For Unattended traffic the following traffic thresholds will apply for low traffic periods:

20 sessions per day, per customer, per Data Recipient Software Product
100 total calls per session
5TPS per session
50 TPS per Data Recipient Software Product
For Unattended traffic during high traffic periods only best effort support is required.

For secure traffic (both Customer Present and Unattended) the following traffic thresholds will apply:

300 TPS total across all consumers
For Public traffic (i.e. traffic to unauthenticated end points) the following traffic thresholds will apply:

300 TPS total across all consumers (additive to secure traffic)
As traffic from Data Recipient Software Products to Data Holders will be shaped by the thresholds above, there are no specific thresholds applicable to secondary Data Holders.

Data Recipient Requirements
Data Recipient Software Products will be limited by the traffic thresholds documented in the previous section. In addition to this Data Recipients are expected to design their services according to the following principles:

Services should be designed to minimise traffic with Data Holders
Services should be designed to be resilient in the case of the rejection of a call by a Data Holder due to traffic threshold breaches
Services should schedule unattended calls to avoid high traffic periods
Unattended calls should be managed to avoid short term bursts of traffic
Reporting Requirements
The mechanism for reporting will be via the CDR Administration Endpoints.

The following information is to be reported:

Availability for current month
Availability for each of the previous twelve months
Percentage of calls within performance threshold for current day
Percentage of calls within performance threshold for each of the previous seven days
Number of calls within each performance tier for current day
Number of calls within each performance tier for each of the previous seven days
Average response time within each performance tier for current day
Average response time within each performance tier for each of the previous seven days
Number of sessions for current day
Number of sessions for each of the previous seven days
Peak total TPS for current day
Peak total TPS for each of the previous seven days
Average TPS for current day
Average TPS for each of the previous seven days
Number of calls resulting in error due to server execution for current day
Number of calls resulting in error due to server execution for each of the previous seven days
Number of calls rejected due to traffic thresholds for current day
Number of calls rejected due to traffic thresholds for each of the previous seven days
Number of customers with active authorisations
Number of Data Recipient Software Products with active authorisations
Data Latency
Within this proposal there is no specific requirement with regard to data latency (ie. how up to date data should be). Instead, the requirement for data latency is that data presented via API end points should be commensurate to data presented via other primary digital channels.

For example, for a Bank that provides a mobile application as their primary digital experience, a balance presented via one of the balance end points should be the same as the balance presented through the mobile application.

To be able to manage network efficiency using normal mechanisms, a data holder making secondary responsibility requests may cache the results from the secondary data holder for a short period of time to accommodate repeated, duplicate, calls from the Data Recipient Software Product. Any such cache should be short lived.

Data Quality
Data holders are required to take reasonable steps to ensure that CDR data, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, is accurate and up to date.

A data holder is required to be able to demonstrate that reasonable steps to maintain data quality are being undertaken.

Exemptions To Protect Service
In the event of the following extreme circumstances data holders will be able to obtain relief from non-functional requirements:

Periods of time when the digital channels for the data holder are the target for a distributed denial of service or equivalent form of attack (this should result in http error 429 Too Many Requests being returned).
A significant increase in traffic from a poorly designed or misbehaving Data Recipient Software Product (this should result in http error 429 Too Many Requests being returned).
If the data holder identifies a situation where there is the potential for physical or financial harm or abuse (this should result in http error 403 Forbidden being returned).
Banking APIs
This specification defines the APIs for Data Holders exposing Banking endpoints.

GET /banking/accounts/{accountId}/transactions

Obtain transactions for a specific account.

Some general notes that apply to all end points that retrieve transactions:

Where multiple transactions are returned, transactions should be ordered according to effective date in descending order
As the date and time for a transaction can alter depending on status and transaction type two separate date/times are included in the payload. There are still some scenarios where neither of these time stamps is available. For the purpose of filtering and ordering it is expected that the data holder will use the "effective" date/time which will be defined as:
Posted date/time if available, then
Execution date/time if available, then
A reasonable date/time nominated by the data holder using internal data structures
For transaction amounts it should be assumed that a negative value indicates a reduction of the available balance on the account while a positive value indicates an increase in the available balance on the account
For aggregated transactions (ie. groups of sub transactions reported as a single entry for the account) only the aggregated information, with as much consistent information accross the subsidiary transactions as possible, is required to be shared
Endpoint Version
Version	1
Parameters
Name	In	Type	Required	Description
accountId	path	ASCIIString	mandatory	ID of the account to get transactions for. Must have previously been returned by one of the account list end points.
oldest-time	query	DateTimeString	optional	Constrain the transaction history request to transactions with effective time at or after this date/time. If absent defaults to newest-time minus 90 days. Format is aligned to DateTimeString common type
newest-time	query	DateTimeString	optional	Constrain the transaction history request to transactions with effective time at or before this date/time. If absent defaults to today. Format is aligned to DateTimeString common type
min-amount	query	AmountString	optional	Filter transactions to only transactions with amounts higher or equal to than this amount
max-amount	query	AmountString	optional	Filter transactions to only transactions with amounts less than or equal to than this amount
text	query	string	optional	Filter transactions to only transactions where this string value is found as a substring of either the reference or description fields. Format is arbitrary ASCII string. This parameter is optionally implemented by data holders. If it is not implemented then a response should be provided as normal without text filtering applied and an additional boolean field named isQueryParamUnsupported should be included in the meta object and set to true (whether the text parameter is supplied or not)

GET /banking/products

Obtain a list of products that are currently openly offered to the market

Note that the results returned by this end point are expected to be ordered in descending order according to lastUpdated.

Conventions
In the product reference payloads there are a number of recurring conventions that are explained here, in one place.

Arrays Of Features
In the product detail payload there are a number of arrays articulating generic features, constraints, prices, etc. The intent of these arrays is as follows:

Each element in an array has the same structure so that clients can reliably interpret the payloads
Each element as a type element that is an enumeration of the specific aspect of a product being described, such as types of fees.
Each element has a field name additionalValue. This is a generic field with contents that will vary based on the type of object being described. The contents of this field for the ADDITIONAL_CARDS feature is the number of cards allowed while the contents of this field for the MAX_LIMIT constraint would be the maximum credit limit allowed for the product.
An element in these arrays of the same type may appear more than once. For instance, a product may offer two separate loyalty programs that the customer can select from. A fixed term mortgage may have different rates for different term lengths.
An element in these arrays may contain an additionalInfo and additionalInfoUri field. The additionalInfo field is used to provide displayable text clarifying the purpose of the element in some way when the product is presented to a customer. The additionalInfoUri provides a link to externally hosted information specifically relevant to that feature of the product.
Depending on the type of data being represented there may be additional specific fields.
URIs To More Information
As the complexities and nuances of a financial product can not easily be fully expressed in a data structure without a high degree of complexity it is necessary to provide additional reference information that a potential customer can access so that they are fully informed of the features and implications of the product. The payloads for product reference therefore contain numerous fields that are provided to allow the product holder to describe the product more fully using a web page hosted on their online channels.

These URIs do not need to all link to different pages. If desired, they can all link to a single hosted page and use difference HTML anchors to focus on a specific topic such as eligibility or fees.

Linkage To Accounts
From the moment that a customer applies for a product and an account is created the account and the product that spawned it will diverge. Rates and features of the product may change and a discount may be negotiated for the account.

For this reason, while productCategory is a common field between accounts and products, there is no specific ID that can be used to link an account to a product within the regime.

Similarly, many of the fields and objects in the product payload will appear in the account detail payload but the structures and semantics are not identical as one refers to a product that can potentially be originated and one refers to an account that actual has been instantiated and created along with the associated decisions inherent in that process.

Dates
It is expected that data consumers needing this data will call relatively frequently to ensure the data they have is representative of the current offering from a bank. To minimise the volume and frequency of these calls the ability to set a lastUpdated field with the date and time of the last update to this product is included. A call for a list of products can then be filtered to only return products that have been updated since the last time that data was obtained using the updated-since query parameter.

In addition, the concept of effective date and time has also been included. This allows for a product to be marked for obsolescence, or introduction, from a certain time without the need for an update to show that a product has been changed. The inclusion of these dates also removes the need to represent deleted products in the payload. Products that are no long offered can be marked not effective for a few weeks before they are then removed from the product set as an option entirely.

updated-since	query	DateTimeString	optional	Only include products that have been updated after the specified date and time. If absent defaults to include all products
brand	query	string	optional	Filter results based on a specific brand
product-category	query	string	optional	Used to filter results on the productCategory field applicable to accounts. Any one of the valid values for this field can be supplied. If absent then all accounts returned.
page	query	PositiveInteger	optional	Page of results to request (standard pagination)
page-size	query	PositiveInteger	optional	Page size to request. Default is 25 (standard pagination)
x-v	header	string	mandatory	Version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer. The data holder should respond with the highest supported version between x-min-v and x-v. If the value of x-min-v is equal to or higher than the value of x-v then the x-min-v header should be treated as absent. If all versions requested are not supported then the data holder must respond with a 406 Not Acceptable. See HTTP Headers
x-min-v	header	string	optional	Minimum version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer if provided. The data holder should respond with the highest supported version between x-min-v and x-v. If all versions requested are not supported then the data holder must respond with a 406 Not Acceptable.

Properties
Name	Type	Required	Description
additionalFeeInformation	string	optional	Free text field containing additional information of the fees for this contract
pricingModel	string	mandatory	The pricing model for the contract. Contracts for gas must use SINGLE_RATE. Note that the detail for the enumeration values are:
SINGLE_RATE - all energy usage is charged at a single unit rate no matter when it is consumed. Multiple unit rates may exist that correspond to varying volumes of usage i.e. a ‘block’ or ‘step’ tariff (first 50kWh @ X cents, next 50kWh at Y cents etc.
SINGLE_RATE_CONT_LOAD - as above, but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water service, pool pump etc.
TIME_OF_USE - energy usage is charged at unit rates that vary dependent on time of day and day of week that the energy is consumed
TIME_OF_USE_CONT_LOAD - as above, but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water service, pool pump etc.
FLEXIBLE - energy usage is charged at unit rates that vary based on external factors
FLEXIBLE_CONT_LOAD - as above, but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water service, pool pump etc.
QUOTA - all energy usage is charged at a single fixed rate, up to a specified usage quota/allowance. All excess usage beyond the allowance is then charged at a single unit rate (may not be the best way to explain it but it is essentially a ‘subscription’ or telco style product i.e. $50/month for up to 150kWh included usage
timeZone	string	conditional	Required if pricingModel is set to TIME_OF_USE. Defines the time zone to use for calculation of the time of use thresholds
isFixed	boolean	mandatory	Flag indicating whether prices are fixed or variable
variation	string	conditional	Free text description of price variation policy and conditions for the contract. Mandatory if isFixed is true
onExpiryDescription	string	optional	Free text field that describes what will occur on or prior to expiry of the fixed contract term or benefit period
paymentOption	[string]	mandatory	Payment options for this contract
intrinsicGreenPower	object	optional	Describes intrinsic green power for the plan. If present then the plan includes a percentage of green power in the base plan. Should not be present for gas contracts
» greenPercentage	RateString	mandatory	Percentage of green power intrinsically included in the plan
controlledLoad	EnergyPlanControlledLoad	conditional	Required if pricing model is SINGLE_RATE_CONT_LOAD or TIME_OF_USE_CONT_LOAD
incentives	EnergyPlanIncentives	optional	Optional list of incentives available for the contract
discounts	EnergyPlanDiscounts	optional	Optional list of discounts available for the contract
greenPowerCharges	EnergyPlanGreenPowerCharges	optional	Optional list of charges applicable to green power
eligibility	EnergyPlanEligibility	optional	Eligibility restrictions or requirements
fees	EnergyPlanFees	optional	An array of fees applicable to the plan
solarFeedInTariff	EnergyPlanSolarFeedInTariff	optional	Array of feed in tariffs for solar power

GET /common/customer

Obtain basic information on the customer that has authorised the current session

Conventions
In the customer payloads relevant conventions are explained here, in one place.

Given Names
firstName represents the first of a person's given names.

middleNames represents a collection of given names if the person has more than one given name.

Where a data holder holds a person's given names as a single string in source systems, it may not possible in some situations to reliably split these given names into their component first and middle names. In these situations, data holders MAY use the firstName field to return the single string of given names and an empty middleNames array.

For example, a person whose given names are "John Paul Winston" but the data holder cannot determine what is the first name, can return "firstName": "John Paul Winston".

Endpoint Version
Version	1
Parameters
Name	In	Type	Required	Description
x-v	header	string	mandatory	Version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer. The data holder should respond with the highest supported version between x-min-v and x-v. If the value of x-min-v is equal to or higher than the value of x-v then the x-min-v header should be treated as absent. If all versions requested are not supported then the data holder must respond with a 406 Not Acceptable. See HTTP Headers
x-min-v	header	string	optional	Minimum version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer if provided. The data holder should respond with the highest supported version between x-min-v and x-v. If all versions requested are not supported then the data holder must respond with a 406 Not Acceptable.
x-fapi-interaction-id	header	string	optional	An RFC4122 UUID used as a correlation id. If provided, the data holder must play back this value in the x-fapi-interaction-id response header. If not provided a [RFC4122] UUID value is required to be provided in the response header to track the interaction.
x-fapi-auth-date	header	string	optional	The time when the customer last logged in to the Data Recipient Software Product. Required for all resource calls (customer present and unattended). Not to be included for unauthenticated calls.
x-fapi-customer-ip-address	header	string	optional	The customer's original IP address if the customer is currently logged in to the Data Recipient Software Product. The presence of this header indicates that the API is being called in a customer present context. Not to be included for unauthenticated calls.
x-cds-client-headers	header	Base64	optional	The customer's original standard http headers Base64 encoded, including the original User Agent header, if the customer is currently logged in to the Data Recipient Software Product. Mandatory for customer present calls. Not required for unattended or unauthenticated calls.

Secondary Responsibility
 Note that the Secondary Responsibility section is currently considered non-binding. This status will be changed by a decision of the Chair after the CDR rules relating to the energy sector are finalised.
This section outlines standards related to Secondary Responsibility Requests. These standards are applicable to CDR data clusters that are designated to be provided by a Secondary Data Holder via a CDR request to a Data Holder.

These standards define the information security mechanisms by which a Data Holder will connect with a Secondary Data Holder to fulfil a valid CDR request and the endpoints that the Secondary Data Holder will expose to fulfil such a request.

Energy
For the energy sector requests for the following data clusters are Secondary Responsibility Requests for which the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is the single designated data holder: * NMI Standard Data * Energy Usage * Distributed Energy Resources

CDR requests for these data clusters to a Data Holder MUST be fulfilled by a request to AEMO.

Security Profile
In its function as market operator of the National Energy Market, AEMO already maintains a registration process for industry participants and shares data with participants using real time, RESTful APIs. This is done via the platform known as the e-Hub.

These processes currently include support processes for registration, maintenance of certificates, and the management of change. Documentation includes a developer portal, API documentation and a security profile. More information is published by AEMO.

The e-Hub platform and associated mechanisms ([EHUB]) will be considered a normative standard for the requesting of data from AEMO to fulfil Secondary Responsibility Requests.

Normative References
Reference	Description	Version
[EHUB]	AEMO e-Hub business to business procedures	Standards dated 9/4/2021
AEMO Endpoints
AEMO will expose the following end points, to retailers only, to service Secondary Responsibility Requests:

Get Service Points: Obtain high level details for a list of service points
Get Service Point Detail: Obtain the detail for a specific service point
Get Usage For Service Point: Obtain a list of electricity usage data from a particular service point
Get Usage For Specific Service Points: Obtain the electricity usage data for a specific set of service points
Get DER For Service Point: Obtain a list of DER data for a particular service point
Get DER For Specific Service Points: Obtain DER data for a specific set of service points
The endpoints above MUST be implemented by AEMO exactly as they would be by Data Holders designated for the energy sector unless explicitly indicated otherwise in the following sections.

Secondary Base Path
The term secondary will be added to the URI path for these the AEMO versions of the endpoints to create a clear separation between the secondary data holder version of the endpoints and the primary data holder version of the endpoints.

For instance, the primary endpoint: GET <base>/energy/electricity/servicepoints would become the secondary endpoint: GET <base>/secondary/energy/electricity/servicepoints

Endpoint Variations
The following variations to the endpoints published by AEMO from the energy sector endpoints apply:

The x-fapi-auth-date header MUST NOT be passed to AEMO and AEMO MUST NOT require this header
The x-fapi-customer-ip-address header MUST NOT be passed to AEMO and AEMO MUST NOT require this header
The x-cds-client-headers header MUST NOT be passed to AEMO and AEMO MUST NOT require this header
A new header named x-cds-arrangement must be passed to AEMO for every invocation. This header should contain the arrangement ID for the consent that the request is being made under and will be used for tracing and audit purposes. This field MUST be populated but AEMO MUST NOT seek to validate the consent associated with the arrangement
All occurrences of the servicePointId field, whether in a request, a response, or as a query parameter should be populated with the equivalent NationalMeteringId in plain text
Fields in the links object for all responses MUST be translated by the Data Holder into values that are valid for a Data Recipient to be able to call back to the Data Holder
The Get Service Points end point MUST be changed from a GET to a POST and will have the same request payload as the Get Usage For Specific Service Points endpoint
Additional Requirements
The following statements also apply to the endpoints published by AEMO:

General headers should be provided as if the request were coming from the primary Data Holder and not propagated from the call made by the Data Recipient
The x-fapi-interaction-id header must be propagated from the Data Recipient call to AEMO to allow for end to end tracing. If not supplied by the Data Recipient, the primary Data Holder MUST create a unique value for the x-fapi-interaction-id header before calling AEMO
Endpoints that require knowledge of the NMIs that belong to the CDR Consumer have been excluded from the AEMO endpoint set. This includes Get Bulk Usage and Get Bulk DER. When a primary Data Holder is required to respond to these endpoints they should call the equivalent endpoint for specific service points and provide the specific list of NMIs to AEMO
Some primary Data Holders may interact with AEMO using multiple participant IDs. For these Data Holders it is possible that a single request from a CDR Consumer covering multiple NMIs would require multiple calls to AEMO if the NMIs were associated with multiple participant IDs owned by the Data Holder. In this scenario the retailer MUST call AEMO multiple times and aggregate the results before responding to the Data Recipient
If a request for usage data spans a time period when AEMO cannot definitively determine that the primary Data Holder was not in control of the NMI then:
AEMO MUST NOT respond with an error
AEMO MUST respond with the usage for the period that the primary Data Holder can be definitively determined to be in control of the NMI
AEMO MUST NOT share data outside the period of control of the primary Data Holder
The primary Data Holder MUST ensure that the data requested and then shared with the Data Recipient is not outside the bounds of control of the specific CDR Consumer
Known Issues
There are certain aspects of the standards that are actively under review. These known issues are articulated in the following table.

Issue	Description
Banking and Common swagger is combined	Common entity definitions to be split out into a separate swagger which can be leveraged by Banking, Energy and Register APIs. This will create a separate Banking APIs swagger that references the common swagger specification.
Register APIs use local version of common definitions	The Register APIs use a locally defined version of common schema definitions such as ResponseErrorList for error responses. These need to be updated to reference common swagger specifications inherited by the Common Swagger spec.
Register APIs don't specify standardised CDR error codes	The Register APIs need to be changed to support common CDR error codes to be consistent with the rest of the data standards.
Register APIs use different field type definitions	The Register APIs define their own field types that are not consistent with the Common Field Types defined in the data standards. As part of porting the Register standards across to the primary data standards, the field types need to be re-aligned to use the common field type definitions. For example, string (data-time) should be changed to DataTime and integer(int32) should be changed to PositiveInteger.
DCR and Register Swagger naming conventions	The DCR and Register naming conventions are not consistent with the broader data standards. Field names should be standardised to camelCase and snake_case inline with the data standards
